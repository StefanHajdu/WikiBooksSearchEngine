It was first published in 2011 by [[Vanguard Press]]. Trump had previously attempted to create a television series titled \'\'Trump Tower\'\', modeled after \'\'[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]\'\', \'\'[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]\'\', and \'\'[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]\'\'. He worked with MVP Entertainment, contracted a writer in Los Angeles, and successfully had [[Showtime Networks]] develop a [[television pilot]]. After receiving a payment for television rights to \'\'Trump Tower\'\', he marketed the idea to [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]]. The book by this title was developed in 2011 listing Trump, but when released in 2012 credited Robinson as sole author.\n\nThe plot of the book is set within a fictional version of [[Trump Tower]], with Trump himself appearing as a character in the work. Detailed sex acts are depicted including [[BDSM]] and the [[rape]] of a woman. An employee of the building is described having sex on the set of \'\'[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]\'\'. The plot moves from [[erotica]] to murder mystery, and the building manager is initially a suspect before later being cleared. [[Bill Clinton]] and other celebrities appear in [[cameo appearance]]s.\n\n\'\'[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]\'\' placed the work within the genre of [[erotic literature]]. A book review in the \'\'[[New York Post]]\'\' compared the storyline to the novel \'\'[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]\'\' (2011). \'\'Playground Magazine\'\' wrote that Trump Tower was itself a [[Phallus|phallic object]] in the work. \'\'[[The Huffington Post]]\'\' called the book "incredibly sexist". \'\'[[Tango Magazine]]\'\' said it had high levels of [[Kink (sexual)|sexual kinkiness]]. \'\'[[New York Magazine]]\'\' called it "a very very sexist novel". \'\'[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]\'\' host [[Stephen Colbert]] discussed the book on his show.\n\n==

The book was published in hardcover format in 2011. The coauthors became familiar with each other through mutual work at [[The Learning Annex]], and \'\'[[The Art of the Deal]]\'\'.  Trump was impressed by Kiyosaki\'s writing success with \'\'[[Rich Dad Poor Dad]]\'\'. The coauthors then wrote \'\'[[Why We Want You to be Rich]]\'\' together in 2006, and followed it up with \'\'Midas Touch\'\' in 2011.\n\nTrump and Kiyosaki intersperse financial lessons with personal anecdotes from their respective careers. They elaborate on points previously raised in \'\'Why We Want You to be Rich\'\', and criticize a dearth of [[financial literacy]] education in the U.S. system. The authors warn of the [[middle-class squeeze]] and the harm this will cause to the [[American middle class]]. They praise entrepreneurship and advise aspiring business owners to embrace failure and learn from it. Trump and Kiyosaki end the book by extolling the economic benefits of [[immigration to the United States]].\n\nThe book received a positive review from \'\'[[Publishers Weekly]]\'\', which called Trump and Kiyosaki, "the gold standard of the entrepreneurial spirit". The review called the book a "galvanizing narrative", and "an impassioned argument for business self-actualization". \'\'[[Kirkus Reviews]]\'\' praised the combination of Trump and Kiyosaki, "the authors complement each other surprisingly well". In its overall assessment, \'\'Kirkus Reviews\'\' concluded the book was "Serviceable but undermined by its political proselytizing." \'\'[[The Intercept]]\'\' called [[multi-level marketing]] a form of [[pyramid scheme]] and lamented the authors\' recommendation of the tactic. Both \'\'[[BuzzFeed|BuzzFeed News]]\'\' and \'\'[[Business Insider]]\'\' contrasted advice in the book with messages from the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016]].\n\n==

It is regarded as one of Tolstoy\'s finest literary achievements and remains an internationally praised classic of [[world literature]].Moser, Charles. 1992. \'\'Encyclopedia of Russian Literature\'\'. Cambridge University Press, pp. 298\xe2\x80\x93300.Thirlwell, Adam [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/08/classics.leonikolaevichtolstoy "A masterpiece in miniature"]. \'\'The Guardian\'\' (London, UK) October 8, 2005Briggs, Anthony. 2005. "Introduction" to \'\'War and Peace\'\'. Penguin Classics.\n\nThe novel chronicles the [[French invasion of Russia]] and the impact of the [[Napoleonic era]] on [[Tsarist]] society through the stories of five Russian [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families. Portions of an earlier version, titled \'\'The Year 1805\'\', were serialized in \'\'[[The Russian Messenger]]\'\' from 1865 to 1867 before the novel was published in its entirety in 1869.Knowles, A. V. \'\'Leo Tolstoy\'\', Routledge 1997.\n\nTolstoy said \'\'War and Peace\'\' is "not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle." Large sections, especially the later chapters, are philosophical discussions rather than narrative.  The writer rewrote the novel several times.  Tolstoy also said that the best [[Russian literature]] does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call \'\'War and Peace\'\' a novel. Instead, he regarded \'\'[[Anna Karenina]]\'\' as his first true novel.\n\n==
