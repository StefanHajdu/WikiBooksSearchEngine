      [[satire|satirical]] [[war novel]] by American author [[Joseph Heller]]. He began writing it in 1953; the novel was first published in 1961. Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century,<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1868619.stm |title=What is Catch-22?

      it uses a distinctive non-chronological [[Narrative mode#Third-person, omniscient|third-person omniscient]] narration, describing events from the points of view of different characters. The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline
      develops along with the plot. The novel is set during [[World War II]], from 1942 to 1944. It mainly follows the life of [[antihero]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[John Yossarian]], a [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]]
      [[B-25]] convoy academy academy academy academy [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]]. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th US Army Air Squadron is based on the island of [[Pianosa]], in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] west of Italy, though it also covers episodes from
      basic training at [[Lowry Field]] in Colorado and Air Corps training at [[Santa Ana Army Air Base]] in California. The novel examines the [[absurdity]] of war and military life through the experiences of Yossarian and his cohorts, who attempt to
      maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home. The book was made into a [[Catch-22 (film)|film adaptation]] in 1970, directed by [[Mike Nichols]]. In 1994, Heller published a sequel to the 1961 novel
      entitled ''[[Closing Time (novel)|Closing Time]]''. == Synopsis == The development of the novel can be split into segments. The first (chapters 1–11) broadly follows the story fragmented between characters, but in a single chronological time in 1944.
      The second (chapters 12–20) flashes back to focus primarily on the "Great Big Siege of [[Bologna]]" before once again jumping to the chronological present of 1944 in the third part (chapter 21–25). The fourth (chapters 26–28) flashes back to the
      origins and growth of [[Milo Minderbinder|Milo's]] syndicate, with the fifth part (chapter 28–32) returning again to the narrative present and maintaining the tone of the previous four. The sixth and final part (chapter 32 and on) remains in the
      story's present, but takes a much darker turn and spends the remaining chapters focusing on the serious and brutal nature of war and life in general.<ref name="Burhans">Clinton S.

      Previously the reader had been cushioned from experiencing the full horror of events, but in the final section, the events are laid bare. The horror begins with the attack on the undefended Italian mountain village, with the following chapters
      involving despair ([[Doc Daneeka]] and the [[Chaplain Tappman|chaplain]]), disappearance in combat ([[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] and Clevinger), disappearance caused by the army (Dunbar) or death of most of [[Yossarian]]'s friends ([[Nately]], McWatt, Kid
      Sampson, Dobbs, Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe), culminating in the horrors of Chapter 39, in particular the rape and murder of the innocent young woman, [[Aarfy#Michaela|Michaela]].<ref name="Burhans"/>
      In Chapter 41 the full details of the gruesome death of [[Yossarian#Snowden|Snowden]] are finally revealed. Nevertheless, the novel ends on an upbeat note with Yossarian learning of [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr's]] miraculous escape to Sweden and Yossarian's
      pledge to follow him there. == Style == Many events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about each event from each iteration, with the new information often completing a joke, the setup of
      which was told several chapters previously. The narrative's events are out of sequence, but events are referred to as if the reader is already familiar with them so that the reader must ultimately piece together a timeline of events. Specific words,
      phrases, and questions are also repeated frequently, generally to comic effect.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}
      Much of Heller's prose in ''Catch-22'' is circular and repetitive, exemplifying in its form the structure of a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]. [[Circular reasoning]] is widely used by some characters to justify their actions and opinions. Heller
      revels in [[paradox]]. For example: "[[The Texan (fictional character)|The Texan]] turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him"; and "The case against Clevinger was open and shut. The only thing missing
      was something to charge him with." This atmosphere of apparently logical irrationality pervades the book, especially.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}
      This style is also recognizable regarding how exactly Clevinger's trial would be executed by Lieutenant Scheisskopf: "As a member of the Action Board, Lieutenant Scheisskopf was one of the judges who would weigh the merits of the case against
      Clevenger as presented by the prosecutor. Lieutenant Scheisskopf was also the prosecutor. Clevinger had an officer defending him. The officer defending him was Lieutenant Scheisskopf."<ref name="Catch-22">{{cite book | first=Joseph | last=Heller | title=Catch-22 | publisher=Simon & Schuster | location=New York | date=June 1961 | orig-year=1961 | isbn=0-684-83339-5 | oclc=35231812 | type=hardback | url=https://archive.org/details/catch2200hell_0 }}</ref>{{rp|76}}
      While a few characters are most prominent, especially Yossarian and the Chaplain, the majority of named characters are described in detail with fleshed out or multidimensional personas to the extent that there are few if any "minor characters". There
      are no traditional heroes in the novel, reflecting the underlying commentary that war has no heroes, only victims.<ref name="Rosenbaum">{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2011/08/catch-22-the-awful-truth-people-miss-about-heller-s-great-novel.html|title=Catch-22: The awful truth people miss about Heller's great novel.|last=Rosenbaum|first=Ron|date=2011-08-02|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> Although its nonchronological structure may at first seem random, ''Catch-22'' is highly structured. It is founded on a structure of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]]; ideas run into one another through seemingly random connections. For example, Chapter 1, titled "The Texan", ends with "everybody but the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|CID man]], who had caught a cold from the fighter captain and come down with pneumonia."<ref name="Catch-22"/>{{rp|24}} Chapter 2, titled "Clevinger", begins with "In a way, the CID man was pretty lucky because outside the hospital the war was still going on."<ref name="Catch-22"/>{{rp|25}} The CID man connects the two chapters like a free association bridge and eventually Chapter 2 flows from the CID man to Clevinger through more free association links. == Themes == === Paradox === [[Yossarian]] comes to fear his commanding officers more than he fears the Germans attempting to shoot him down and he feels that "they" are "out to get him". The reason Yossarian fears his commanders more than the enemy is that as he flies more missions, [[Colonel Cathcart]] increases the number of required combat missions before a soldier may return home; he reaches the magic number only to have it retroactively raised. He comes to despair of ever getting home and is greatly relieved when he is sent to the hospital for a condition that is almost [[jaundice]]. In Yossarian's words: {{quote| The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which ''side'' he's on, and that includes Colonel Cathcart. And don't you forget that, because the longer you remember it, the longer you might live.<ref name="Catch-22" />{{rp|124}}}} === Tragedy and farce === Much of the farce in the novel is fueled by intentional and unintentional miscommunication, occasionally leading to tragic consequences. For example, Cathcart's desire to become a general is thwarted by ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen sabotaging his correspondence. Major Major's and Yossarian's mis-censoring of correspondence is blamed on the Chaplain, who is threatened with imprisonment as a result. === Theodicy === Yossarian questions the idea that God is all-powerful, all-good, and all knowing. The narrator seems to believe that God, if not evil, is incompetent. In chapter 18, Yossarian states that he "believes in the God he doesn't believe in", this version of God having created Hitler, the war, and all the failures of human life and society, as exemplified in the following passage:<blockquote>"And don't tell me God works in mysterious ways", Yossarian continued, hurtling over her objections. "There's nothing so mysterious about it. He's not working at all. He's playing or else He's forgotten all about us. That's the kind of God you people talk about—a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did he ever create pain? … Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain! [to warn us of danger] Why couldn't He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of His celestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person's forehead. Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn't He? … What a colossal, immortal blunderer! When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly little mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. …"<ref name="Rosenbaum"/></blockquote>Later Heller writes of Yossarian wandering through a war-torn Italian city (Chapter 39): <blockquote>"Yossarian quickened his pace to get away, almost ran. The night was filled with horrors, and he thought he knew how Christ must have felt as he walked through the world, like a psychiatrist through a ward full of nuts, like a victim through a prison full of thieves. What a welcome sight a leper must have been. At the next corner a man was beating a small boy brutally in the midst of an immobile crowd of adult spectators who made no effort to intervene&nbsp;..."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Catch-22|last=Heller|first=Joseph|publisher=Random House|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-43722-2|pages=514}}</ref>
    </blockquote>
    === Anti-capitalism === While the military's enemies are Germans, none appear in the story as enemy combatants. This ironic situation is epitomized in the single appearance of German personnel in the novel, who act as pilots employed by the
    squadron's mess officer, [[Milo Minderbinder]], to bomb the American encampment on Pianosa. This predicament indicates a tension between traditional motives for violence and the modern economic machine, which seems to generate violence simply as
    another means to profit, quite independent of geographical or ideological constraints which creates a [[military–industrial complex]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/book-reviews-tuesday-tome-catch-22-joseph-heller/|title=Rocks and Hard Places Galore: The Bureaucratic Appropriation of War in Joseph Heller's Catch-22|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=October 27, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|series=Your Tuesday Tome|access-date=February 21, 2016}}</ref> Heller emphasizes the danger of profit-seeking by portraying Milo without "evil intent".

    == Characters ==

    == Influences == Heller wanted to be a writer from an early age. His experiences as a [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] during World War II inspired ''Catch-22'';<ref>{{cite magazine | first=DM | last=Craig | title=From Avignon to Catch-22 | magazine=[[War, Literature & the Arts]] |volume=6 | issue=2 | date=1994 | pages=27–54}}</ref>
    Heller later said that he "never had a bad officer". In a 1977 essay on ''Catch-22'', Heller stated that the "antiwar and antigovernment feelings in the book" were a product of the Korean War and the 1950s rather than World War II itself. Heller's
    criticisms are not intended for World War II but for the Cold War and [[McCarthyism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Joseph|title=The Sixties|year=1977|publisher=Random House/Rolling Stone Press|location=New York|editor=Lynda Rosen Obst|pages=50–52|chapter=Reeling in Catch-22}}</ref>
    The influence of the 1950s on ''Catch-22'' is evident through Heller's extensive use of [[anachronism]]. Though the novel is ostensibly set in World War II, Heller intentionally included anachronisms like [[loyalty oaths]] and [[computers]] (IBM
    machines) to situate the novel in the context of the 1950s.<ref name="Sorkin 1993 150"/>
    Many of the characters are based on or connected to individuals from the 1950s: * Milo Minderbinder's maxim "What's good for M&M Enterprises is good for the country" alludes to the former president of [[General Motors]] [[Charles Erwin Wilson]]'s
    statement before the Senate: "What's good for General Motors is good for the country."<ref name="Sorkin 1993 150"/>
    * The question of "Who promoted [[Major Major Major Major|Major Major]]?" alludes to [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s questioning of the promotion of [[Irving Peress|Major Peress]], an army dentist who refused to sign loyalty oaths.<ref name="Sorkin 1993 150"/>
    Czech writer [[Arnošt Lustig]] recounts in his book ''3x18'' that Joseph Heller told him that he would never have written ''Catch-22'' had he not first read ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk]]'' by [[Jaroslav Hašek]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Zenny |last=Sadlon |url=http://www.zenny.com/Heller.html |title=Personal testimony by Arnošt Lustig |publisher=Zenny.com |access-date=March 11, 2011}}</ref>
    In 1998, some critics raised the possibility that Heller's book had questionable similarities to [[Louis Falstein]]'s 1950 novel, ''[[Face of a Hero]]''. Falstein never raised the issue between ''Catch-22''{{'s}} publication and his death in 1995 and Heller claimed never to have been aware of the obscure novel. Heller said that the novel had been influenced by [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline|Céline]], [[Evelyn Waugh|Waugh]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]. Many of the similarities have been stated to be attributable to the authors' experiences, both having served as U.S. Army Air Forces aircrew in Italy in World War II. However, their themes and styles are different.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/29/books/critic-s-notebook-questioning-the-provenance-of-the-iconic-catch-22.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The New York Times]] |title= Critic's Notebook; Questioning the Provenance of the Iconic ''Catch-22'' |first= Mel |last= Gussow |author-link=Mel Gussow |date= April 29, 1998 |access-date= April 1, 2010}}</ref> == Concept == A "[[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]" is "a problem for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule."<ref>catch-22, Merriam-Webster. Retrieved March 8, 2012 http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catch%2022</ref> For example, losing something is typically a conventional problem; to solve it, one looks for the lost item until one finds it. But if the thing lost is one's glasses, one cannot see to look for them – a Catch-22. The term "Catch-22" is also used more broadly to mean a tricky problem or a no-win or absurd situation. In the book, Catch-22 is a military rule typifying [[bureaucratic]] operation and reasoning. The rule is not stated in a precise form, but the principal example in the book fits the definition above: If one is crazy, one does not have to fly missions; and one must be crazy to fly. But one has to apply to be excused, and applying demonstrates that one is not crazy. As a result, one must continue flying, either not applying to be excused, or applying and being refused. The narrator explains: <blockquote>There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to, but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. (p. 56, ch. 5)</blockquote> Other forms of Catch-22 are invoked throughout the novel to justify various bureaucratic actions. At one point, victims of harassment by military police quote the MPs' explanation of one of Catch-22's provisions: "Catch-22 states that agents enforcing Catch-22 need not prove that Catch-22 actually contains whatever provision the accused violator is accused of violating." Another character explains: "Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing." Yossarian comes to realize that Catch-22 does not actually exist, but because the powers that be claim it does, and the world believes it does, it nevertheless has potent effects. Indeed, because it does not exist, there is no way it can be repealed, undone, overthrown, or denounced. The combination of force with specious and spurious legalistic justification is one of the book's primary motifs. The motif of bureaucratic absurdity is further explored in 1994's [[Closing Time (novel)|''Closing Time'']], Heller's sequel to ''Catch-22''. This darker, slower-paced, apocalyptic novel explores the pre- and post-war lives of some of the major characters in ''Catch-22'', with particular emphasis on the relationship between Yossarian and tail gunner Sammy Singer. == Literary allusions == ''Catch-22'' contains allusions to many works of literature. [[Howard Jacobson]], in his 2004 introduction to the Vintage Classics publication, wrote that the novel was "positioned teasingly&nbsp;... between literature and literature's opposites&nbsp;– between [[Shakespeare]] and [[Rabelais]] and [[Dickens]] and [[Dostoevsky]] and [[Gogol]] and [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline|Céline]] and the [[Absurdism|Absurdists]] and of course [[Kafka]] on the one hand, and on the other [[vaudeville]] and [[slapstick]] and [[The Phil Silvers Show|Bilko]] and [[Abbott and Costello]] and [[Tom and Jerry]] and [[the Goons]] (if Heller had ever heard of the Goons)."<ref>[[Random House]] {{ISBN|978-0-09-947046-5}} [http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/vintage/classics/home.htm Vintage Classics]</ref> One critic argues that it is Kafka's influence that can be seen most strongly in the novel: "Like Kafka's heroes, Yossarian is riddled with anxiety and caught in an inexorable nightmare – in his case created by Colonel Cathcart and the inevitability of his raising the number of missions he has to fly."<ref>[http://www.humanities-ebooks.co.uk/book/Reading_Catch-22 McDonald, Paul. ''Reading Catch-22''. Humanities E-Books]</ref> == Historical context == The idea for ''Catch-22'' was based on Joseph Heller's personal experience in World War II. The feelings that Yossarian and the other bomber crew felt were taken directly from problems he suffered while on duty. Heller flew 60 bombing missions from May to October in 1944. Heller was able to make it out of the war, but it took until 1953 before he could start writing about it. For this reason, the book contains references to post World War II phenomena like IBM computers and [[loyalty oath]]s. The war experience turned Heller into a "tortured, funny, deeply peculiar human being".<ref>{{cite news|last=Bailey|first=Blake|title=The Enigma of Joseph Heller|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/books/review/the-enigma-of-joseph-heller.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=bookreviews|access-date=May 7, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 26, 2011}}</ref>
  After publication in 1961, ''Catch-22'' became very popular among teenagers at the time. ''Catch-22'' seemed to embody the feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time
  took along a copy of ''Catch-22''. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States. On October 26, 1986, professor and author [[John W. Aldridge]] wrote a piece in
  ''[[The New York Times]]'' celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publishing of ''Catch-22''. He commented that Heller's book presaged the chaos in the world that was to come:
  <blockquote>The comic fable that ends in horror has become more and more clearly a reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities of the world in which we live and hope to survive.<ref>{{cite news|last=Aldridge|first=John W.|title=The Loony Horror of it all - ''Catch-22'' Turns 25|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/15/home/heller-loony.html|access-date=March 1, 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 26, 1986}}</ref>

  The opening chapter of the novel was first published, in 1955, by ''[[New World Writing]]'' as ''Catch-18'', but Heller's agent, Candida Donadio, asked him to change the title, to avert its confusion with [[Leon Uris]]'s recently published ''[[Mila

  ''Catch-17'' was rejected so as not to be confused with the World War II film ''[[Stalag 17]]'', as was ''Catch-14'', apparently because the publisher did not believe that 14 was a "funny number". Eventually, the title came to be ''Catch-22'', which,

    hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller-coaster of a book") and ''[[The New York Times]]'' ("A dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it delights"). On the other hand, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' ("doesn't even seem to be
    written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper", "what remains is a debris of sour jokes") and a second review from the ''New York Times'' ("repetitive and monotonous. Or one can say that it is too short because none of
    its many interesting characters and actions is given enough play to become a controlling interest")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipl.org/div/litcrit/bin/litcrit.out.pl?ti=cat-860 |title=The Internet Public Library: Online Literary Criticism Collection |publisher=Ipl.org |access-date=March 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106035214/http://www.ipl.org/div/litcrit/bin/litcrit.out.pl?ti=cat-860 |archive-date=January 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
    disliked it. One commentator of ''Catch-22'' recognized that "many early audiences liked the book for just the same reasons that caused others to hate it".<ref name="Catch-22 1994">{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Joseph|title=Catch-22|year=1994| orig-year=1961publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-50233-6}}</ref>{{rp|11}}
    The book had a cult following though, especially among teenagers and college students. Heller remarks that in 1962, after appearing on the ''Today'' show he went out drinking with the host at the time, [[John Chancellor]], who handed him stickers
    that Chancellor had got privately printed reading "YOSSARIAN LIVES". Heller also said that Chancellor had been secretly putting them on the walls of the corridors and executive bathrooms in the NBC building.<ref name="Catch-22 1994"/>{{rp|11}}
    Although the novel won no awards upon release, it has remained in print and is seen as one of the most significant American novels of the 20th century.<ref name="BBC"/>

    Although he continued writing, including a sequel novel ''[[Closing Time (novel)|Closing Time]]'', Heller's later works were inevitably overshadowed by the success of ''Catch-22''. When asked by critics why he'd never managed to write another novel
    as good as his first, Heller would retort with a smile, "Who has?"<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://www.economist.com/node/21531414|title=Joseph Heller and his fiction. The first cut is the deepest.|journal=The Economist|date=October 8, 2011|access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref>

Originally published in 1969 by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]], the novel details the story of a fictional [[American Mafia|Mafia]] family in [[New York City]] (and [[Long Island]]), headed by [[Vito Corleone]], the Godfather. The novel covers the years 1945 to 1955 and includes the back story of Vito Corleone from early childhood to adulthood. The first in a [[The Godfather (book series)|series of novels]], ''The Godfather'' is noteworthy for introducing Italian words like ''[[consigliere]]'', ''[[caporegime]]'', ''[[Cosa Nostra]]'', and ''[[omertà]]'' to an English-speaking audience. It inspired a [[The Godfather|1972 film of the same name]]. Two film sequels, including new contributions by Puzo himself, were made in [[The Godfather Part II|1974]] and [[The Godfather Part III|1990]]. ==Summary== The [[Corleone family]], one of the Five Families of the New York Mafia, fights the other four families in a brutal war in the years after [[World War II]]. After Don Vito Corleone is shot by men working for drug kingpin Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo, Corleone's two sons, Santino (Sonny) and Michael, must run the family business with the help of ''consigliere'' Tom Hagen and the family's two trusted ''caporegimes'', Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. When Michael murders Sollozzo and his bodyguard, corrupt NYPD Captain Mark McCluskey, while meeting with them in a restaurant, the conflict escalates into a full-scale war which results in Sonny's murder. Michael must return from hiding in Sicily to assume control of the family as the new Don. Under his retired father's tutelage, Michael orchestrates a plan to extract revenge, while relocating the Corleone family's power base to Las Vegas in order to further his goal of legitimizing the family and getting them out of organized crime. This encompasses the murder of all of the Corleone family's enemies, including Michael's brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi, who played a part in Sonny's murder. After selling all of the family's remaining businesses in New York, the Corleones permanently move to Las Vegas. ==Main characters== The Corleone family patriarch is [[Vito Corleone]] (the Don), whose surname represents the Sicilian town of his birth, [[Corleone]]. His birth name is Vittorio Andolini, but after immigrating to the United States following the deaths of his parents and brother, he changed it to the name of his home village as one of his few acts of sentimentality. Vito fathered four children: [[Santino "Sonny" Corleone|Sonny Corleone]], [[Fredo Corleone]], [[Michael "Mike" Corleone|Michael Corleone]], and [[Connie Corleone]]. He also has an informally adopted son, [[Tom Hagen]], who became the Corleone family's ''[[consigliere]]'' (counselor). Vito Corleone is also godfather to the famous singer and movie star [[Johnny Fontane]]. The godfather referred to in the title is Vito, but the story's main character becomes Michael. The novel's central storyline details Michael's destiny to succeed his father as the head of the family empire, despite his desire to lead an Americanized life with his girlfriend (and eventual wife) [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay Adams]]. The Corleone family is a criminal organization with national influence, notably protection, gambling and union racketeering. Serving as the Don's [[underboss]] is his oldest son, Sonny. The operational side of the organization is headed by two ''caporegimes'', [[Peter Clemenza]] and [[Salvatore Tessio]]. Other significant [[List of The Godfather characters|members of the organization]] include Connie's abusive husband [[Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)|Carlo Rizzi]] and enforcers [[Luca Brasi]] and [[Al Neri]]. ==Reception== In the [[New York Times]], Roger Jellinek wrote that the book was "bound to be hugely successful, and not simply because the Mafia is in the news. Mr. Puzo's novel is a voyeur’s dream, a skillful fantasy of violent personal power without consequences. The victims of the Corleone 'family' are hoods, or corrupt cops – nobody you or I would actually want to know. Just business, as Don Vito would say, not personal. You never glimpse regular people in the book, let alone meet them, so there is no opportunity to sympathize with anyone but the old patriarch, as he makes the world safe for his beloved 'family.'"<ref>{{cite news| location=New York| work=The New York Times| first=Roger | last=Jellinek | title=Just Business, Not Personal| date=4 March 1969}}</ref> The novel remained on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for 67 weeks and sold over nine million copies in two years.<ref>{{cite web | title="The Godfather" Turns 40 |work=CBS News|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-godfather-turns-40/3/ | date=March 15, 2012 | access-date=July 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717004801/http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-godfather-turns-40/3/ |archive-date=July 17, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> ==Film adaptation== {{Main|The Godfather}} The 1972 film adaptation of the novel was released with [[Marlon Brando]] as Don Vito Corleone and [[Al Pacino]] as Michael Corleone, directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. Mario Puzo assisted with both the writing of the screenplay and other production tasks. The film grossed approximately $269 million worldwide and won various awards, including three [[Academy Awards]], five [[Golden Globe]]s and one [[Grammy]]. The film is considered to be tremendously significant in cinematic history. The sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' won six [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]s, and became the first sequel to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. The film's plot follows the novel except for such details as backstories of some characters that are excluded, although they were filmed. Some of this footage was included in later re-edited versions such as, "The Godfather Saga." The subplot involving Johnny Fontane in Hollywood was not filmed. The most significant deviation of the film from the novel was that the latter had a more positive ending than the film in which Kay Corleone accepts Michael's decision to take over his father's business. The film ends with Kay's realization of Michael's callousness, a theme that would develop in the [[The Godfather Part II|second]] and [[The Godfather Part III|third]] films, which are largely not based on the original novel. Vito Corleone's backstory appeared in the second film, with his character portrayed by [[Robert De Niro]]. ===Video game adaptation of the film=== {{Main|The Godfather (2006 video game)}} The video game company [[Electronic Arts]] released a [[video game]] adaptation of ''The Godfather'' film on March 21, 2006. The player assumes the role of a "soldier" in the family. Prior to his death, [[Marlon Brando]] provided some [[Voice-over|voice work]] for [[Vito Corleone|Vito]], which was eventually deemed unusable and was dubbed over by a Brando impersonator. [[Francis Ford Coppola]] said in April 2005 that he was not informed of Paramount's decision to allow the game to be made and he did not approve of it.<ref>''[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6121958.html Godfather film director whacks Godfather game]'' - by Tor Thorsen, [[GameSpot]], April 8, 2005, Retrieved April 8, 2005.</ref> [[Al Pacino]] declined to participate, and his likeness was replaced with a different depiction of [[Michael Corleone]]. ==Sequels== In 1984, Puzo's literary sequel to ''[[The Godfather]]'' was published. Titled ''[[The Sicilian]]'', it chronicles the life of "Giuliano" ([[Salvatore Giuliano]]) but the Corleone family is featured heavily throughout, [[Michael Corleone]] in particular. Chronologically this story sits between Michael's exile to [[Sicily]] in 1950 and his return to the United States. For copyright reasons, the Corleone family involvement was cut from the [[Michael Cimino]] [[The Sicilian (film)|film adaptation]], which is not considered part of the [[The Godfather (film series)|'' Godfather'' film series]]. In 2004, [[Random House]] published a sequel to Puzo's ''The Godfather'', ''[[The Godfather Returns]]'', by [[Mark Winegardner]]. A further sequel by Winegardner, ''[[The Godfather's Revenge]]'', was released in 2006. These novels continue the story from Puzo's novel. ''The Godfather Returns'' picks up the story immediately after the end of Puzo's ''The Godfather''. It covers the years 1955 to 1962, as well as providing significant backstory for Michael Corleone's character prior to the events of the first novel. The events of the film ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' all take place within the timeframe of this novel, but are only mentioned in the background. The novel contains an appendix that attempts to correlate the events of the novels with the events of the films. ''The Godfather's Revenge'' covers the years 1963 to 1964. Continuing Puzo's habit, as seen in ''The Godfather'', of featuring characters who are close analogs of real-life events and public figures (as Johnny Fontane is an analog of [[Frank Sinatra]]), Winegardner features in his two ''Godfather'' novels analogs of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.|Joseph]], [[John F. Kennedy|John F.]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]], as well as alleged organized crime figure [[Carlos Marcello]] (Carlo Tramonti). In ''[[The Godfather Returns]]'', Winegardner also dramatizes the [[Apalachin Meeting|sweep of organized crime arrests]] that took place in [[Apalachin, New York]], in 1957. Winegardner uses all of the characters from the Puzo novels and created a few of his own, most notably Nick Geraci, a Corleone [[soldato|soldier]] who plays a pivotal role in the sequel novels. Winegardner further develops characters from the original novel, such as [[Fredo Corleone]], [[Tom Hagen]], and Johnny Fontane. In 2012, a prequel based on an unproduced screenplay by Mario Puzo titled ''[[The Family Corleone]]'', was written by [[Edward Falco|Ed Falco]]. It tells the story of how [[Vito Corleone]] rises to Don and how [[Sonny Corleone]] and [[Tom Hagen]] enter the family business. ==Literary references== The Corleone family closely resembles the Karamazov family in ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'': a powerful father, an impulsive oldest son, a philosophical son, a sweet-tempered son, and an adopted stepson who is maintained as an employee. [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s novel ''[[Le Père Goriot]]'' (1835) has been the inspiration for notable lines that have gained wide popularity in cinema history. Similarly, Puzo opened his 1969 novel with an epigraph popularly attributed to Balzac: "Behind every great fortune there is a crime." The saying is most likely evolved over time from Balzac's original text: "The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out because it was properly executed."<ref>[http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/09/09/fortune-crime/#more-7188 Quote Investigator]: Comédie Humaine by Honoré de Balzac, Edited by George Saintsbury, Old Goriot (Le Père Goriot) (1896), Translated by Ellen Marriage, Quote Page 124, J.

      {{italic title}}
      '''''Hijo de hombre''''' (''Son of Man'', 1960) is a novel by the [[Paraguay]]an author [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]. Roa Bastos' first published novel, ''Hijo de Hombre'' represents his definitive break with poetry.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=38}}
      It portrays the struggle between the governing [[élite]] and the oppressed in Paraguay from 1912 until 1936, just after the end of the [[Chaco War]] with [[Bolivia]].{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=40}}
      This novel draws upon a system of [[Christianity|Christian]] metaphors as part of the [[Neobaroque]] concept of [[Magic Realism]] to examine the pain of being Paraguayan.{{sfn|Marcos|1992|p=487}}
      ''Hijo de Hombre'' contrasts two figures: Miguel Vera and Cristóbal Jara. Vera narrates the odd chapters, although he might also be the narrator of all nine chapters (this is unclear).{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=40}}
      He is a well-to-do and educated romantic supporter of revolution, who is unable to take real action to support his ideals, and in the end betrays them (not unlike [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]).{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=39}}
      Jara, on the other hand, is an uneducated “son of man” who becomes a Christ-like leader for Paraguayan people through action and strength of character and will lead them to salvation. Although it was a massive critical success, Roa Bastos remained
      quite dissatisfied with the work for a number reasons. According to the Monthly Review Press printing of the English translation (MRP, 1988): "''Son of Man'' was first published in English by Victor Gallancz Ltd., copyright 1965 by Victor Gallancz
      Ltd. It was originally published in Spanish under the title ''Hijo de Hombre'', copyright 1961 by Editorial Losado, S.A., Buenos Aires." The MRP edition is translated by Rachel Caffyn and published in the Voices of Resistance Series. There is a
      4-page Foreword by Ariel Dorfman and a 15-page Afterword by Jean Franco. This paperback's text of the work itself is 249 pages. ISBN 0-85345-733-6 (pbk.). The contents as follows: Chapter 1, Son of Man, set in Itape, is the story of Gaspar Mara, the
      leper, and Macario Francia, beggar (pgs. 15-41). Chapter 2, Wood & Flesh, set in Sapukai, is the story of the Russian doctor in 1917 (pgs. 42-60). Chapter 3, Stations, set in Itape, is a Sapukai to Asuncion train trip (pgs. 61-78). Chapter 4, Exodus,
      set in the Takuru-Puku Mate slave plantation, is the story of the escape of Casiano & Nati in 1914 (pgs. 79-113). Chapter 5, Home, set in Sapukai, is the story of following the self-made railroad track to find Casiano's coach in 1932 (pgs. 114-129).
      Chapter 6, Fiesta, set in Sapukai, is the story of the Paraguayan Army, having defeated the rebels, looking for Cristobal and prisoners taken off by train in 1932 (pgs. 130-160). Chapter 7, Doomed Men, set in the prison camp of Pena Hermosa,
      imprisoned on an island penal colony as well as in the Army at the siege of Boqueron in the Chaco War (pgs. 161-190). Chapter 8, Special Mission, set in the Chaco, is the story of trying to get a convoy of trucks to the lone company (pgs. 191-235).
      Chapter 9, Aftermath, set in Itape after the Chaco War in 1935-36 (pgs. 236-263). Chapters 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 narrated by Miguel Vera, who is identified in Chapter 6 (p. 134) as being banished for his seditious activity, "an officer of the Military
      Academy Academy Academy Academy Academy Academy Academy Academy Academy", a Lieutenant.

    The book quickly became a bestseller, paving the way for other Mailer's works such as ''[[The Deer Park]]'', ''[[Advertisements for Myself]]'', and ''[[The Time of Our Time]]''. He believed ''The Naked and the Dead'' to be his most renowned work. It

    century]]. ==Plot==
    {{long plot|date=October 2020}}
    The novel is divided into four parts: Wave; Argil and Mold; Plant and Phantom; and Wake. Within these parts are chorus sections, consisting of play-like dialogue between characters, as well as Time Machine sections, which give brief histories and
    flashbacks of individual characters’ lives. The story takes place on Anopopei, a fictional island somewhere in the South Pacific. American forces are faced with a campaign to drive out the Japanese so that Americans can advance into the Philippines.
    The novel focuses on the experiences of one platoon. ===Part One - Wave=== Staff Sergeant Sam Croft, Woodrow Wilson, and Roy Gallagher are playing cards the night before a scheduled attack. They are members of a recon platoon fighting in the Asian
    theater of World War II on a fictional island named Anopopei. The next morning, as the platoon takes boats to the island, they are nervous. Sgt. William Brown and Cpl. Stanley talk about women and the other men in their squad. The assault begins, and
    as the platoon waits for their scheduled turn to come to the island, they nervously joke amongst themselves. Once the squad reaches the beach, they begin digging foxholes. Stanley picks a fight with Oscar Ridges and Red Valsen, but ultimately Red
    knows the time is not right for a fight, and he backs down. Croft leaves to find his commanding officer. Once they’ve begun to settle in on the beach, the Japanese begin to attack. The platoon splits up. Cpl. Toglio, Hennessey, and Ridges have
    completed their foxholes, so they stay on the beach. Brown, Gallagher, Wilson, Red, Stanley, and Sgt. Julio Martinez run after Croft. As the beach is shelled, Hennessey panics and soils himself. He runs down the beach in an attempt to clean his
    pants, but he is killed by shrapnel. ===Part Two - Argil and Mold=== Croft pleads with higher officers to give him more men to replace those lost. He ultimately earns an extra replacement man, bringing the depleted platoon up to fourteen out of an
    intended twenty. Roth and Goldstein, two of the new men in the platoon, bond over their shared Jewish heritage. Lt. Robert Hearn snaps at the officers' table, towards a couple other officers. Major General Edward Cummings steps in to prevent the
    situation from escalating further. Hearn and Cummings form an odd friendship. The two talk in Cummings’ tent at night. They discuss philosophy and Cummings analyzes Hearn’s personality based on his behavior. Cummings tells Hearn that, as an officer,
    he must develop resentment for the enlisted men. An intense storm comes in, destroying all the work the enlisted men had done the previous week building a bivouac. Tents go flying and everyone tries to stay as dry as they can. In an effort to keep
    the men’s spirits up during the storm, Red leads them in song. General Cummings makes the rounds to evaluate the storm damage and good-naturedly tells the men to expect a Japanese attack. Cummings makes further preparations up and down the line for
    the attack. Roth and Minetta are separated from the rest of the squad, and when they hear gunfire, they assume recon must be in the middle of a firefight. As Roth keeps watch, he falls asleep at his post and wakes up Stanley a half hour late. The
    next day, the other half of the platoon moves anti-tank guns, which is difficult because of all the mud. Wyman drops his leg of the gun, and it rolls all the way back down a hill. When he tries to take responsibility, Croft thinks he’s covering for
    Goldstein, who he blames instead. The entire platoon meets back up, and as they sleep, they’re attacked by Japanese soldiers. Luckily, Croft is one of the men on watch when they attack, and he leads the platoon in repelling the Japanese, killing
    multiple Japanese soldiers. Toglio gets hit in the arm during the battle, which means he’ll get to go home. The soldiers say he’s lucky because his wound won’t prevent him from doing anything once it heals, but he still gets to return to America. The
    Japanese attack up and down the American lines, but the Americans fend off the attack at all points. Cummings and Hearn continue their antagonistic relationship and Cummings assigns Hearn to oversee the construction of a recreation tent for the
    officers. Hearn realizes he is feeling the resentment towards the enlisted men that Cummings predicted. The two discuss the nature of war, soldiers, and fighting. They also discuss politics and philosophy, and Cummings beats Hearn in a game of chess.
    Cummings tells Hearn, “My wife is a bitch.” It is implied that Cummings is gay. “Between [Cummings and Hearn]...was the uncomfortable realization that they did not like each other at all.” Croft, Red and Gallagher run into four Japanese soldiers in
    the forest, who don’t notice them. Croft throws a grenade, killing three of the soldiers. Red goes to finish off the remaining soldier, but his gun jams. The soldier rushes Red with a bayonet, and Red trips and falls. Croft comes out and stops the
    soldier from killing Red, and the Japanese man surrenders. Red goes back to camp, and Croft and Gallagher take the soldier prisoner. Croft gives the prisoner a cigarette and some chocolate. The prisoner shows them a picture of his family, and
    Gallagher tells him that his wife is going to have a baby shortly. Croft gives him another cigarette and then shoots him in the face, which brings him a perverse sense of pleasure. Wilson hears about a sergeant in another platoon who makes good
    liquor. He borrows money from a few other men to buy some. Wilson buys four canteens and brings three back to the squad, hiding one for himself. The men get drunk together. Wilson offers Goldstein a drink, but he refuses, saying that he is in the
    middle of writing a letter to his wife. The men mock Goldstein for being Jewish, and he realizes he hates everyone around him. He writes to his wife that he cannot remember why he is fighting. The drunk members of the platoon look for corpses to
    loot, but only find bodies that have been picked clean of “souvenirs.” Wilson drinks the canteen he stashed away before he goes on watch. As he stands by the machine gun, drunk, he sees a bush that he thinks would be a good hiding spot for a Japanese
    soldier, so he shoots the bush. The men wake up in a rush, thinking they are under attack. When Croft realizes that Wilson is the only one shooting, he yells at him. Hearn sits on a beach relaxing with the other officers as the enlisted men work in
    the forest. He realizes he does not like any of the other officers, and he has stronger feelings of resentment towards the enlisted men. The men discuss all the important men they knew back in the States, and one of them claims to have known Hearn’s
    father. Hearn quickly realizes that this man did not know his father, and he likely didn’t know any of the other important people he claimed to know either. Major Dalleson makes an officer with a camera take pictures of him shooting pebbles with his
    carbine to send back to his skeet shooting club back home. A load of mail comes in. Wyman is upset because he didn’t get anything from his girl back home. Red comforts him. Wilson’s wife is angry that he doesn’t send more money, and Wilson has
    Gallagher transcribe an angry response for him. Gallagher reads his own letters and feels a pang of jealousy to discover that an old friend earned a promotion that he was once up for. The chaplain calls Gallagher in and reports to him that his wife
    has died in childbirth, but his child survived. He continues to get letters from his wife, however. When the last letter arrives, Gallagher freaks out. He wonders what the point of fighting is. “He thought of Hennessy and his mouth tightened. Get
    your head blown off...for what, for what?” Stanley, who just made corporal, clashes with Sgt. Brown. The two are unsure how to relate to each other. Stanley tells a story about a time he stole and then repaid money from a store he worked at to buy
    cheap furniture. From the beach, Croft spots a couple Japanese soldiers in the forest. The platoon, led by Croft, shoots them both, but Minetta is hit in the leg. Brown expresses a contempt for women to Stanley, who begins to wonder if his own wife
    is being faithful. The fighting settles down for a few weeks, and the lines begin to become stagnant. Cummings worries that the men are getting too comfortable in one place, which will make them unwilling to fight. He fears that if he cannot shift
    the front line, he will be replaced. His anxiety leads to health problems and constant outbursts directed at Hearn. Cummings commands Hearn to have Clellan, an enlisted man, put flowers in his tent each morning. This inspires conflict between Hearn
    and Clellan, which is what Cummings intends. Hearn becomes frustrated and easily provoked. Cummings instructs him to go pick up supplies for the officers’ mess hall, but secretly pays off the seller to keep the goods from Hearn. Hearn bribes an
    assistant to get the supplies and later realizes what Cummings has done. The incident reframes Hearn’s past experiences with Cummings, which he realizes have all been aimed to anger him. Furious, Hearn extinguishes a cigarette on the floor of
    Cummings’s tent when Cummings is gone. Cummings discovers that a sergeant has been falsifying his patrol reports and realizes that his entire command has likely been doing the same thing. He vows to crack down on disciplinary issues. He returns to
    his tent to discover Hearn’s cigarette. He summons Hearn to his tent for the first time since they played chess. They have an intense discussion about the war and what will happen afterwards. Cummings reiterates his distaste for women. Cummings
    explains to Hearn that he wants to be a type of god. Cummings smokes a cigarette and throws it on the ground, just as Hearn did. He commands Hearn to pick up the cigarette or he will be court-martialed. Hearns asks him for a transfer to another
    division and Cummings denies his request and tells him to work labor under Dalleson. Hearns cuts Cummings back by asking, “Short of bringing in every man in the outfit, all six thousand of them, and letting them pick up your cigarettes, how are you
    going to impress them?” Minetta is in the hospital from his gunshot wound, which is healing quickly. He worries that he will be sent back to the front lines, so he deliberately re-opens his own wound. When he realizes he will likely be discharged, he
    decides that he would rather feign insanity in order to get sent home than return to the platoon. Minetta fires his gun in the medical tent and yells about enemy soldiers. A doctor is skeptical, but Minetta is sent to a separate tent for mental
    patients. Minetta spends a couple days in the mental ward and realizes he can’t take it anymore, so he claims to have woken up with no memory of the past week. The doctor who was skeptical pulls him aside and tells him that he knew Minetta was
    faking. When Minetta goes back to the platoon, he reports that the hospital was nicer than the front, so Red and Wilson try to report as sick. The doctors dismiss Red, but they caution Wilson that he’ll need surgery after the war. Cummings tries to
    devise a new attack plan. He thinks long and hard about the most effective ways to outmaneuver the Japanese army. He comes up with a plan that he thinks will be militarily successful and also inspire the men to fight hard. Cummings asks Dalleson what
    he would think if Cummings transferred Hearn to another unit, which Dalleson perceives as odd, since generals usually wouldn’t be concerned with such minutiae. Hearn is doing busywork recording patrol logs when Dalleson comes in. The two begin to
    scrap, but Cummings interrupts. He asks Hearn to bring him a large and heavy map, which Hearn semi-accidentally drops on Cummings’s foot. When Cummings hears that he will not get naval support, he has to adjust his attack plan. He comes up with a new
    strategy. The plan is to send a recon squad, led by Hearn, who Cummings will transfer, to scout a trail from the backside of the island towards the beach, thereby allowing Cummings to send in a full company through that route from the back. The
    secondary company would then overpower the beach defenses, allowing for a full invasion from the beach. ===Part Three - Plant and Phantom=== Hearn joins the recon platoon on the boat to the other side of the island. He immediately realizes that Croft
    knows more than he does, and he doesn’t want the rest of the squad to realize that. Croft immediately dislikes Hearn because Hearn tries to befriend the men in the squad. Stanley tells Croft that he wishes Croft were still in charge. All the men are
    anxious about their own standing within the platoon, particularly the noncommissioned officers. Brown and Martinez discuss their fears. Croft and Hearn struggle for control of the platoon early in the mission, and Croft takes what Hearn will give
    him. Roth and Minetta struggle to keep up with the rest of the platoon as they try to bushwack through the jungle. Croft gets on them for being slow, and Minetta snaps at Croft. Croft realizes Hearn will soon get comfortable around the platoon and
    take more control. Goldstein and Ridges end up doing most of Roth and Minetta’s work. Minetta picks on Roth for being Jewish, and Goldstein, who is also Jewish, takes Minetta’s side. The platoon slowly works their way through the jungle, cutting
    leaves at a rate of about two yards a minute. It takes them five hours to get through the jungle to open fields. Hearn and Croft continue to subtly struggle for power. Hearn wants to try to go through a pass in the mountain range, but Croft wants to
    go over the mountain. Hearn continues to try to befriend the men in the platoon, which further angers Croft. Martinez, as the best at forging a trail, walks in front. Hearn stays in the back of the squad and realizes that no matter what he does he
    will not be able to get the men to like him. The platoon comes across an exposed field. Hearn and Croft decide to split the platoon into two groups, one to lead the way and the other to provide cover. Croft offers to lead the first group, but Hearn
    elects to do it himself. The first group gets about halfway through the field when they begin taking fire. Hearn freezes when the shooting stops and realizes he is waiting for Croft to give an order. This realization frustrates him enough to get him
    to move. He leads the group in a retreat. They move away from the field for ten minutes before they realize Wilson is missing. Wilson was shot in the stomach during the skirmish. He hides in a patch of tall grass, unseen to Japanese soldiers who he
    can hear talking. Croft, Red, Gallagher, Ridges, and Goldstein go back to the field to get Wilson. They bring him back to the rest of the platoon and realize his injury is too severe for him to continue the mission. Polack, Roth, and Minetta are
    getting materials to build for a stretcher for Wilson, but Roth gets distracted by a baby bird. Everyone is looking at the bird as Croft builds the stretcher. Croft sees them gathered around the bird and goes into a rage. He crushes the bird and
    throws it. The men are furious about it, and Red decides that enough is enough and challenges Croft. Hearn breaks up the fight and orders Croft to apologize. He does so reluctantly and only becomes more angry at Hearn. Brown, Stanley, Ridges, and
    Goldstein are assigned to carry Wilson back to the beach, and four more men (Minetta, Wyman, Polack, and Gallagher) go with them to help until they’re far from Japanese lines, leaving just five men: Hearn, Croft, Red, Roth, and Martinez. After
    Minetta, Wyman, Polack, and Gallagher return to the rest of the platoon, Brown stresses over the responsibility that he has been given. He realizes how important it is to him that they bring Wilson back alive. Back on the other side of the island,
    Cummings is pleasantly surprised by how well the attacks are going. He realizes he has misjudged his men’s morale, but it has worked out for the best since the men are more inclined to fight when they are restless. He receives word that he will
    receive more naval support than he expected, and he wonders if the recon mission was necessary. Roth is experiencing extreme anxiety, which is causing him stomach problems and keeping him from sleeping. He talks to Red and tries to thank him for
    standing up to Croft over the bird. Red recognizes that if he allows himself to become close with Roth, Roth’s death will be more painful, so he deliberately snaps at Roth to keep him distant. Red thinks to himself about the nature of the war. “‘Did
    the GIs die in vain?’ [Red] snorted. Who didn’t know the answer? Of course they died in vain, any GI knew the score.” Hearn realizes that the mission has almost no chance of succeeding now that the Japanese know they’re there. He considers turning
    back, but he decides that he could not face Cummings empty handed. He finally understands that his whole motivation throughout the entire mission was to get back at Cummings. That night, Hearn admits that there is nothing left to be gained, and he
    decides to turn around the next morning. However, Croft persuades him to send out a single man to see if the Japanese are still in the field where they were ambushed. They agree that if the recon man sees anything, they’ll turn back. They pick
    Martinez as the recon man, but before he leaves, Croft tells Martinez to report to Hearn that he saw nothing when he gets back. At first, Martinez sees nothing. However, he soon realizes he has wandered into the middle of a Japanese camp, full of
    sleeping soldiers. He quietly kills the guard and escapes. He makes his way further through the valley and finds another Japanese camp. At this point, Martinez returns to the platoon and reports his findings to Croft. Croft warns him not to say
    anything about what he has seen to Hearn. Croft tells Hearn that Martinez saw nothing on his recon mission, and Hearn feels obligated to try to go through the valley. Hearn is leading the men back through the valley when he is unceremoniously shot
    and killed. Croft feels a sense of relief. “No longer was there that confusion, that momentary internal pause before he gave an order.” The men are generally apathetic about Hearn’s death, seeing him as just another officer. Croft takes control of
    the platoon and decides to take the platoon up and over the mountain. Brown, Stanley, Ridges, and Goldstein are still carrying Wilson back to the beach, which is difficult given the terrain, heat, and fatigue. The group moves about a hundred yards at
    a time. Wilson is drifting in and out of consciousness and swearing at the men carrying him. Brown and Stanley fight. Wilson wants water, but Brown says he can’t have any because he has a stomach wound. Wilson begins to hallucinate. Wilson demands
    that they leave him, and each man individually considers it. Stanley collapses, and Brown stays with him, while Ridges and Goldstein continue to carry Wilson back to the beach. Croft cracks down on discipline to reassert himself as the leader of the
    platoon. Martinez tells the other men that he saw Japanese soldiers on his recon mission the night before, but when he reported it to Hearn, he didn’t believe it. Martinez believes that this is the truth. Martinez and Gallagher, as the Catholics of
    the group, discuss their fear of death, particularly with no priest around to confess their sins to if something were to happen to them. Croft knows that he must reach the top of the mountain, or the trick he pulled that got Hearn killed would be for
    nothing. But the mountain is extremely difficult, and the men are not motivated. Goldstein and Ridges continue to carry Wilson. They are exhausted beyond conversation and can only carry Wilson for ten to fifteen yards at a time. Wilson continues to
    mutter nonsense. By the end of the day, they’ve advanced five miles since they left Brown and Stanley. Cummings leaves the island for Army headquarters to appeal for more naval support. Major Dalleson is left in charge. Dalleson receives a report
    indicating a large breach in the Japanese lines and sees no choice but to attack. He finds himself hoping that the report is untrue, because he is unsure of what to do in the case that the report is correct. He realizes he is unqualified to be
    leading the Army in such a situation, and he wishes Cummings had not left. Dalleson quickly throws together an attack plan, and as the plan is executed, he realizes there are many things he has not considered. Dalleson’s attack is wildly successful.
    The Japanese general is killed, along with much of his support staff. Cummings returns with the destroyer he just begged for, only to find that there is no longer much of a need for it. The destroyer provides a little bit of support from the sea, and
    the Americans essentially wrap up the campaign. Cummings has forgotten entirely about the recon mission. Up on the mountain, the platoon has no idea what is happening with the rest of the campaign. The mountain proves more treacherous than even Croft
    expected, and every man in the platoon, including Croft, feels an internal desire to turn back. Minetta, Wyman, and Roth are dragging behind the rest of the squad. Roth begins to fall every hundred feet or so, to the increasing irritation of the rest
    of the platoon. Roth falls again and tells them to leave him behind. Gallagher hits him and yells, “Get up, you Jew bastard!” The comment angers Roth enough to motivate him to stand and continue. The mountain terrain is becoming increasingly
    dangerous, and they come to a narrow ledge in front of a gap of about four feet. Croft sees no way over it but to jump, and everyone in the platoon achieves the jump with relative ease. Roth knows he cannot make the jump, but as he stands on the
    ledge, he hears Gallagher goading him. He jumps but comes up short and falls to his death. Goldstein and Ridges continue to struggle with Wilson. Ridges can no longer remember why Wilson should not be allowed to have water and gives him some. Ridges
    comes to the realization that no matter what they do, Wilson is going to die. Both Ridges and Goldstein consider leaving Wilson, but they both decide that they cannot for religious reasons. Ridges asks Wilson to repent before he dies, and Wilson, who
    is no longer lucid, agrees. As they rest in preparation to cross a river, Wilson dies. Ridges and Goldstein continue to carry his body, but as they cross the river, they lose it. Ridges and Goldstein make it back to the beach and realize they have
    nothing to do but sit and wait for the rest of the squad. The platoon is shaken after Roth’s death. They move a little bit farther and decide to camp for the night. Gallagher realizes the responsibility he has for Roth’s death. The next morning,
    Gallagher and Martinez turn on Croft and demand that they turn back. However, Croft will not waver and orders the men to continue on. Red declares that he will not continue either, and Croft threatens to shoot him. Red eventually backs down, bringing
    the lengthy power struggle between the two to a conclusion. Red admits to himself that the army “has him licked.” Croft turns around a bend only to directly upset a hornets’ nest. The men run back to evade the hornets, and in their hurry, toss away
    their packs and rifles. Within fifteen minutes, they’ve made it back farther than the place they started that morning. Croft accepts defeat and wearily gives the order that they will go back to the beach and wait for the boat to bring them back to
    the American lines. All the surviving members of the platoon meet back up on the beach. Stanley and Brown arrive only a few hours before Croft’s group. Once the boat picks them up, the men learn that the campaign is essentially over. They share
    laughter for a while, which is slowly replaced by a silent sadness, mixed with uncertainty and frustration that the entire patrol was for naught. ===Part Four - Wake=== In the process of “mopping up,” Cummings discovers that a Japanese supply depot
    had been destroyed by artillery fire weeks before. The Japanese lines had been falling apart for months, and a week before the final attack, the Japanese had run out of ammo. Cummings looks back at his intelligence reports and sees that they gave no
    indication of Japanese weaknesses. “For a moment [Cummings] almost admitted that he had had very little or perhaps nothing at all to do with this victory, or indeed any victory -- it had been accomplished by a random play of vulgar good luck larded
    into a causal net of factors too large, too vague, for him to comprehend. He allowed himself this thought...but it caused him a deep depression.” The novel ends with Major Dalleson thinking of a new way to implement map training exercises, indicating
    that despite the lessons each character in the novel learned about the meaninglessness of war, the structures will remain unchanged. ==Main characters== *'''Hennessey''' is a newer member of the platoon. He is very cautious with all of his gear and
    movements so as to not get killed. When they arrive at the beach of Anopopei, he defecates in his pants out of fear during the opening action scene. He has a mental break down and runs down the beach in hopes of getting new pants. He is killed soon
    after by shrapnel from an exploding mortar shell. *'''Woodrow Wilson''' is a large, impoverished white Southerner. He has a happy-go-lucky and generous nature. In his "Time Machine" we learn Wilson wakes up married to a woman named Alice after a
    drunken night at the bar. Their marriage consists of love affairs and money troubles. Later, Wilson suffers a long, agonizing death after being shot in the stomach by the Japanese; Brown, Goldstein, Ridges, and Stanley try to carry him back to the
    beach to be saved but he dies on the way there. *'''Julio Martinez''' is a Mexican-American from Texas. He is nicknamed Japbait by Croft and made sergeant in General Cummings infantry division. Martinez was terrified, constantly on edge and an
    introvert throughout the beginning of the novel. He however, gains bravery through battle and is an excellent soldier, especially in terms of getting a scope for the land. He is well trusted by the other men in the platoon. Croft convinces Martinez
    to lie about a Japanese platoon he saw on a solo scouting mission, which leads to the death of Hearn and to the men hiking to Mount Anaka under Croft's command. *'''Sam Croft''' has a large ego and is coldblooded throughout the novel. At one point,
    he immorally kills a Japanese POW. Later, he squeezes Roth’s baby bird to death as if he is crushing all innocence. He loves war and is Mailer’s version of a psychopath within the novel. He is seen as one of the best soldiers in the platoon and the
    other men both fear and respect him as a leader. In his time capsule, we learned he was cheated on by the women he loved which led to him being cold and developing a love for war. At the conclusion of the book, Croft refuses to look forward to his
    homecoming, believing that the war will continue for much longer. After all, he enjoys the war because he finds a thrill in killing. *'''Red Valsen''' claims he does not want to rise in the ranks. He appears numb to death and the war itself. As a
    child, he grew up in a mine town in Montana. Later, he runs away from home, losing contact with his entire family. After holding many jobs, Red moves in with his girlfriend Lois and her son. Afraid of commitment, Red joins the Army and runs away from
    Lois. While in the Army, Red loses contact with Lois just like he did with his own family. *'''Lieutenant Robert Hearn''' is the stereotypical white liberal. Harvard educated and from an affluent family, Hearn is General Cummings’ assistant. He
    despises the caste system within the Army, wishing that he could reach out to the lower class foot soldiers. Later, Cummings transfers Hearn to Dalleson’s section. He leads the platoon through the jungle and to the mountain pass. Here, he is shot and
    killed quickly and anticlimactically not expecting Japanese resistance after Croft keeps the information from him. *'''General Edward Cummings''' is power-hungry, often comparing himself to God. As a child, Cummings experiences gender-role confusion.
    This forces his father to send him to military school. Later, Cummings attends West Point. While at West Point, he meets Margaret and feels socially pressured into marrying her. Margaret and Cummings are married and never have children. They have an
    unhappy marriage, perhaps due to Cummings homosexual tendencies and feelings. It is apparent through his conversations with Hearn that he has romantic feelings for him. *'''Roy Gallagher''' is Boston Irish and part of an Anti-Semitic gang called
    Christians United. He always seems angry throughout the novel. Later, he learns that his wife Mary died in childbirth, but their baby lived. Gallagher remains devastated for the rest of the novel. *'''Roth''' is a depressing, fickle stereotypical
    representation of a Jew. He, however, refuses to consider himself and strongly associate with being Jewish. Throughout the novel, he has a superiority complex because he is better educated than the other men of the platoon. Roth dies while climbing
    the mountain because he misses a jump and fails to grasp Gallagher’s hand. *'''Joey Goldstein''' is also Jewish like Roth. However, unlike Roth, he does not view himself as better than his Christian friends. Goldstein grows up as a mamma’s boy and
    desires to own his own shop. Later, he becomes a welder and marries Natalie, despite his mother’s disapproval. After their son is born, Goldstein struggles to support his family and maintain a loving relationship with his wife. Throughout the war,
    Goldstein is well-respected by his comrades, although he does lack courage at times. *'''William Brown''' is the stereotypical well-liked, neighborhood boy. Growing up in a middle-class family, Brown later attends a state university. Here he joins a
    fraternity and flunks out by freshman year. He marries a girl from his high school, Beverly, and lives a fairly boring life. Throughout the war, he worries that Beverly will cheat on him while he’s away. He is certain that he will throw her out of
    the house when he returns home. *'''Stanley''' insists that women are no different from men. He trusts his wife Ruthie, who is the mother of his child. In some ways, he is the quiet feminist within the novel. He is also more ambitious than the other
    soldiers, since he is inexperienced in war; he desires to move up in ranks and befriends Brown in order to do so. *'''Toglio''' is an Italian-American. Patriotic, trusting, and good-natured, he is friends with most of his platoon. He sustains a
    [[million-dollar wound]] during combat and is sent home. Subsequently, as time passes, some characters come to envy his wound and grow to hate him. *'''Casimir "Polack" Czienwicz''' comes from a lower-class Polish family. He grows up with seven
    siblings and, after his father dies, he enters the orphanage. At thirteen, an older woman seduces him multiple times. These experiences make Polack a tough, courageous soldier in the Army. *'''Oscar Ridges''' is extremely Christian. He assures Wyman,
    who refers to him as “the preacher,” that “The Lord’ll keep me from shooting a Christian”.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|218}}
    Despite his Christian beliefs, Ridges befriends Goldstein as his buddy. This friendship between a Jew and Christian demonstrates how the war brought men of different backgrounds together. *'''Buddy Wyman''' does not play a major role within the
    novel. He dreams of becoming a war hero in order to support his mother and himself. *'''Steven Minetta''' is twenty years old and was known as the “best dresser on the block” when he was growing up.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|60}}
    He is eventually wounded but then returns to the platoon. At the conclusion of the novel, Minetta feels anger towards power figures and hopes to “expose the goddam Army.”
    {{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|711}}
    *'''Dalleson''' was second in command to Cummings. He was very nervous throughout the novel and did not trust his own judgment. At the end of the novel, however, it is Dalleson who helps them win the war against the Japanese Army. ==Themes==
    {{original research|section|date=August 2015}}
    Throughout the novel, Mailer dwells on many themes. These themes are recurring throughout his works and reappear in several of his later essays and novels. '''Dehumanization of soldiers''' Commenting on the dehumanization of soldiers in ''The Naked
    and the Dead,'' Mailer said, "The book finds man corrupted, confused to the point of helplessness, but it also find that there are limits beyond which he cannot be pushed."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Shuster |location=New York |page=97}}</ref>
    The narrator illustrates the exhaustion and humiliation of the soldiers' life: “When a man was harnessed into a pack and web belt and carried a rifle and two bandoliers and several grenades, a bayonet and a helmet, he felt as if he had a tourniquet
    over both shoulders and across his chest. It was hard to breathe and his limbs kept falling asleep.”{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|24}}
    Dehumanization of the soldier is also seen in Chapter 5 when the platoon had to carry antitank guns between 1st Battalion and A Company, which was about a mile of muddy trail. The men became numb and only went through the motions of carrying the guns
    and the generals disregarded the soldiers' exhaustion. The soldiers generally believed the army didn't see them as people and that "they don't care if you live or die here [the infirmary]. All they want is to get you back where you can stop a
    bullet".<ref name=":0">{{Citation|chapter=The Naked and the Dead and Its Aftermath|pages=14–33|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|doi=10.2307/j.ctv6sj74q.5|isbn=978-1-61117-806-7|title=Understanding Norman Mailer|year=2017}}</ref>{{rp|354}}
    Mailer described ''The Naked and the Dead'' as "'an odyssey of fear, exhaustion, and death,'" and presents the natural world as "uncaring, unyielding, implacable, and occasionally, beautiful."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Shuster |location=New York |page=73}}</ref>
    He adds insights into soldiers, like Martinez, in this context. Mailer writes that on his scouting mission, "Martinez was functioning more like an animal than a human."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |page=586}}</ref>
    Mailer also distills how dehumanizing the enemy was an essential aspect to the structure of war. Mailer writes, "Martinez had a sense of unreality . . . They were men. The entire structure of war wavered in his brain for a moment."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |page=594}}</ref>
    Mailer concludes the platoon's climb of Mount Anaka, reinforcing the loss of the individual within war, writing that "[the soldiers] did not think of themselves as individual men any longer. They were merely envelopes of suffering. They had forgotten
    about the patrol, about the war, their past, they had even forgotten the earth they had just climbed."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |page=658}}</ref>
    '''Loneliness:''' Loneliness acted as an equalizer among soldiers and officers during the Second World War. Despite divisions of rank, economic, political, sexuality, or class, loneliness was a unilateral phenomenon among soldiers and officers during
    the Second World War. Furthermore, this factored into the construction of brotherhood in wartime. In ''The Naked and the Dead,'' Goldstein feels a connection and a sort of alliance with Roth in their Jewish heritage. Although the men in the platoon
    do have a sense of brotherhood with one another, they still feel alone during their deployment. Throughout the novel, the men long for women and deeper friendships. Roth, for example, wishes to have someone whom he “could talk to seriously.”{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|51}}
    He realizes that he doesn’t know his own comrades very well, since everyone he met when he initially entered the Army was either killed or reassigned somewhere else. The men degrade women through the narrative; however, the absence of women factors
    into their reaction to disparage women, whose presence on the front lines was limited. '''Death:''' The men are faced with unexpected deaths, such as Hennessey's, Wilson, Hearn, Roth, and Gallagher’s wife who dies during childbirth. It is clear death
    surrounds them and their lives could be taken away in any moment. Cummings, having been surrounded by Army deaths the majority of his career, still never warms to the smell of rotting corpses. Red, like the other soldiers, realizes he or one of his
    comrades could be killed any minute. Even when they grew used to death and saw it as "large and devastating and meaningless. Men who were killed were nearly men no longer around", a comrade's death would cause "the idea of death [to be] fresh and
    terrifying again".<ref name=":0"/>{{rp|123}}
    This fear of death also had a negative impact on the mental health and sanity of the men. For instance, Red states, "Goddam Army gets you so you're afraid to turn around".{{rp|12}}
    The men began to have a pessimistic view of life believing "All dead things... everything lives to die"<ref name=":0"/>{{rp|228}}
    This was especially so since "that's all [soldiers] can ever do in the Army, sit and think" which caused the thoughts and fears of death to be constant and prevalent.<ref name=":0"/>
    {{rp|474}}
    The first death in the novel introduces this theme into the narrative. Red observes Hennessey's death. The narrator reveals that "[u]ntil Hennessy had been killed, Red had accepted all the deaths of the men he knew as something large and devastating
    and meaningless . . . Hennessey's death had opened a secret fear."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |page=123}}</ref>
    Croft is also surprisingly moved by Hennessey's death. The narrator declares that "Hennessey's death had opened to Croft vistas of such omnipotence that he was afraid to consider it directly. All day the fact hovered about his head, tantalizing him
    with odd dreams and portents of power."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |page=40}}</ref>
    Gallagher's wife, Mary dies in childbirth in America. When Gallagher learns of her death, he continues to receive letters she sent before her death. Because of the disparity of time and space between men and women and their families during wartime,
    Gallagher considers that Mary "lived for him only at the exact time when he read her letters."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |page=259}}</ref>
    On the mission across Mount Anaka, Roth discovers a baby bird, and the platoon, with the exception of Croft, are fascinated by the bird.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |pages=528–531}}</ref>
    The bird symbolizes innocence and the futility of death during war, as Roth cares for the baby bird and Croft is then enraged by it and crushes the bird in his hand.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |pages=529–530}}</ref>
    Moreover, the contrast between Hearn and Roth's deaths reflects both the bonds of brotherhood made among soldiers during war and the division between rank. Lieutenant Hearn's death is immediate and has little recovery time, with the platoon mourning
    for ten or twenty seconds.<ref name="The Naked and the Dead">{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |pages=602–603}}</ref>
    Croft is even relieved by Hearn's death, as he is now in charge of the platoon again.<ref name="The Naked and the Dead"/>
    In contrast, Roth's death "shatter[s] the platoon."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |page=687}}</ref>
    Instead of choosing to face Croft, Roth chose to risk falling to his death. Not only is the platoon shattered, but Mailer underlines the division between the empowered and powerless, the narrator declares, "It was Croft's fault that Roth had been
    killed."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
    '''Power:''' Mailer's predominant theme throughout ''The Naked and the Dead'' is illustrated through the power relations among the men, especially the relationships between commanding officers and subordinates. Power is distilled in General
    Cummings's character. Cummings compares himself to the “chief monk” and God throughout the book. He also openly supports the class system within the military, and states Hearn must accept the “emotional prejudices of his class”, especially since he
    is an officer. People of higher ranks like Hearn and Cummings, after all, enjoy a better quality of life than the other foot soldiers. They sleep in larger staterooms while the soldiers share small rooms and are jammed into cots. This power system
    and power relations is reinforced within the missions. After Hearn dies, Croft is "relieved" that there is no longer a rival to his power and takes over leading the platoon up the mountain.<ref name=":0"/>{{rp|603}}
    While the other soldiers clearly want to stop and give up, they continue hiking the mountain simply because Croft commands them to. Chickenshit, as termed by [[Paul Fussell]] in ''Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War'', was a
    major aspect of the theme of power in the novel.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/ahr/96.3.843-a|title=Paul Fussell. ''Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War''. New York: Oxford University Press. 1989. Pp. X, 330. $19.95|journal=The American Historical Review|year=1991}}</ref>
    This is shown in how Cummings makes Hearn do humiliating tasks and in the end sends him on a mission knowing he will die, which is the ultimate chickenshit since he sent him to die solely to demonstrate his power. This is another instance where the
    undemocratic nature of the Army is apparent. Analogous to the replacement of "fuck" with "fug," Fussell commented on the obscenity in war, arguing that explicit language in wartime became precious as a way for millions of conscripts to note, in a
    licensed way, their bitterness and anger. During his service in World War II, Mailer did not yet have a plan for his war novel, but knew that he wanted to write a combat novel specifically set in the Philippines where "the American hunger for power
    was palpable."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |page=62}}</ref>
    Mailer told his sister that he wrote to his wife, Bea, about his plans for a novella with "'a ridge or a peak as a symbol' of 'the higher aspirations of man, the craving for the secret, the core of life,'" and the Faustian need for power.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |page=64}}</ref>
    In another letter to his wife, Mailer recounted an encounter with the top mess sergeant, who called him "'a chickenshit son of a bitch.'"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |page=83}}</ref>
    This real life incident inspired Mailer to construct the pivotal confrontation between General Cummings and Lieutenant Hearn which leads indirectly to Hearn's death.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |page=84}}</ref>
    Initially, Cummings burdens Hearn with small, chickenshit tasks,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |page=302}}</ref>
    and later Hearn retaliates within restricted power dynamics by dropping a match on the General's floor and grounds it into the floor with his heel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |page=341}}</ref>
    According to General Cummings, "what Hearn had done was equivalent to a soldier's laying hands on his person."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |page=318}}</ref>
    Thus, Cummings transfers Hearn to the platoon with Croft.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |page=3433}}</ref>
    During World War II, General Patton was considered one of the most fastidious perpetuators of chickenshit, constantly enforcing the Army's dress code on his soldiers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fussell |first1=Paul |title=Wartime: nderstanding and Behavior in the Second World War |date=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=82}}</ref>
    Similarly, in ''The Naked and the Dead,'' Dalleson harps on pride in the outfit of the Army.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |page=384}}</ref>
    [[J. Michael Lennon]], Mailer's definitive biographer, claims that "Mailer's landscape descriptions crackle and pulse with energy and must be ranked among the best of postwar American writers.".<ref name="Norman Mailer: A Double Life">{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |page=63}}</ref>
    Diana Trilling [[Diana Trilling]] observed, "'The most dramatic moments in ''The Naked and the Dead'' are precipitated by intensities in nature.'"<ref name="Norman Mailer: A Double Life"/>
    While writing his combat novel, Mailer stated that "[t]here are going to be troubling terrifying glimpses of order in disorder, of a horror which may or may not lurk beneath the surface of things.'"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |page=89}}</ref>
    Hennessey's death as well as Croft, Reed, and Martinez's "primitive glimpses of a structure behind things" is Mailer's depiction of '"the old business of man constructing little tag-ends of a Gd for himself in his moral wilderness.'"<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |page=90}}</ref>
    Mailer argued that everything is more direct in war and this dramatically impacts the senses and one's perception of realism.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>
    Mailer depicts this theme of power in nature and man's subjection to that in Cummings and Croft's reflection on Mount Anaka.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mailer |first1=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |date=1948 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |pages=563, 701}}</ref>
    '''Homosexuality:''' The theme of homosexuality is most evident through Cummings. In his "Time Machine", Mailer illustrates Cummings growing up experiencing gender-role confusion. Although his mother supports Cummings' identity, his father refuses to
    have a son who is homosexual and thus sends him to military school. This portages the notion of the Army being only for "real men". However, there were a lot of homosexual men who were soldiers during WWII and as [[Allan Bérubé]] illustrates in
    ''Coming Out Under Fire: History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two'', they were often seen as trusted and respected soldiers and medics.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=June 1991|title=Allan Berube. <italic>Coming Out under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two</italic>. New York: Free Press. 1990. Pp. xiii, 377. $22.95|journal=The American Historical Review|doi=10.1086/ahr/96.3.845|issn=1937-5239}}</ref>
    While in the Army, it is clear Cummings developed romantic feelings towards Hearn and sexually desired him. Through Cummings, Mailer illustrates his beliefs of homosexuality. Although Mailer believes being homosexual is evil, it is interesting he had
    the general be the homosexual character in the novel, especially since he depicts the general as being a powerful figure who is a good leader. Mailer also includes homosexual characters in his other works as well, such as in ''[[The Deer Park]].''
    Mailer directly addresses this theme and his beliefs of homosexuality in "The Homosexual Villain" stating he saw homosexuals as evil and always depicted them as the villain in his works but realized they were humans.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mailer, Norman.|title=The homosexual villain|year=1955|oclc=21704456}}</ref>
    Mailer utilizes the trope that men coded as homosexual are villains, repressed, and effeminate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |page=80}}</ref>
    '''Brotherhood:''' ''The Naked and the Dead'' depicts the bonds of brotherhood during World War II, particularly examining the relationships among platoons. During World War II, soldiers developed strong friendships to which civilians could not
    relate. Croft expresses his feelings of brotherhood and tells his comrades, “You’re all good guys. You’re all chicken, and you’re all yellow, but you’re good guys. They ain’t a goddam thing wrong with you.” Mailer's use of Croft in this scene
    emphasizes the unilateral sentiment and necessity of brotherhood during wartime.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|202}}
    The theme recurs in Part III when Brown, Goldstein, Ridges, and Stanley attempt to carry the wounded Wilson back to camp. Despite the physical strains, the men persisted in order to save Wilson. The brotherhood of the platoon is also illustrated by
    the group's reactions to the deaths of Hearn and Roth. New to the platoon, Hearn, when he was killed by Japanese soldiers, the platoon stood shocked for a couple of seconds but quickly moved on under the continued leadership of Croft. However, when
    in the wake of Roth's death, "the platoon was shattered. For ten minutes they huddled together on the shelf, too stricken, too terrified, to move on.<ref name=":0"/>"{{rp|684}}
    The gravity of Roth's death demonstrates the deep bond of brotherhood, pervasive not only during World War II but more specifically among the platoon. '''Masculinity:''' ''The Naked and the Dead'' acts as Mailer's introduction into the literary
    pantheon, and like his later works, Mailer portrays women as sexual objects. Many men, especially Brown, fear their wives are cheating on them while they are at war. This causes them to have more hatred towards women and a deep distrust towards them.
    Brown tells Stanley that if he finds out his wife cheated on him, he will beat her then throw her out.{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|168}}
    Later, in the Chorus “Women,” Polack insists that “there ain’t a fuggin woman is any good” and Brown agrees. Women are especially emphasized within "Time Machine" segments. In these segments, the men’s romantic relationships and sexual experiences
    are described in detail. In many of the "Time Machines", such as Martinez's, women are portrayed as simply sexual objects. In Croft's "Time Machine", we learn was cheated on by the women he loved which resulted in him being cold and having a hatred
    towards women. The men seem to disregard the fact that they have cheated several times on their partners but show extreme hatred in the thought of their wives cheating on them. The only character that seems to positively view his wife is Gallagher,
    who becomes miserable and lost after she dies. This deep hatred for women, however, is a way to mask how strongly these men miss and desire women; they desperately need women for a variety of different reasons. Mailer exemplifies the construction of
    the masculine identity, and analyzes masculinity as socially constructed, context-specific and culture-bound.<ref name="Gendering Men: Re-Visions of Violen">{{cite journal |last1=Armengol |first1=Joseph M. |title=Gendering Men: Re-Visions of Violence as a Test of Manhood in American Literature. |journal=Atlantis |date=2007 |volume=2 |issue=29 |pages=75–92}}</ref>
    [[Male studies]] enforces ''The Naked and the Dead'' as part of American literature which reflects American society's conception of masculinity based on the representation of masculinity in American fiction.<ref name="Gendering Men: Re-Visions of Violen"/>
    The construction of American masculinity predicated off of violence and adventure narratives is particularly distilled in Croft as the typified combat soldier.<ref name="Gendering Men: Re-Visions of Violen"/>
    ==Development== '''Writing development:''' Before he left for basic training, Mailer was certain that he could write "THE war novel" based on his experiences as a cook and the experiences of soldiers in World War II.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Christopher |last=Beha |title=Does Mailer Matter? The Young Writer and the last literary celebrity |journal=Harper's Magazine |issue=88}}</ref> After returning home from the war, he moved to France with his first wife, Beatrice, where he studied at the Sorbonne in [[Paris]]. Here, in just 15 months, Mailer wrote his war novel as noted in his introduction to its Fiftieth Anniversary Edition.<ref name="martinfrost.ws">{{cite web|url=http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/jan2009/norman-mailer.html |title=Frost's Meditations |website=martinfrost.ws |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923062046/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/jan2009/norman-mailer.html |archive-date=September 23, 2013 }}</ref>
    Mailer states his writing inspiration came from the great Russian novelists like [[Leo Tolstoy]]. While writing, Mailer often read "from ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' most mornings before he commenced his own work."{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|7}}
    Mailer believed Tolstoy enabled him to bring compassion to his pages; Tolstoy taught him that "compassion is valueless without severity."{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|8}}
    Mailer was convinced he brought this compassion to ''The Naked and the Dead'', and it is what enabled a 25-year-old to write an incredible war novel. Throughout his writing process, Mailer explained, he "used to write twenty-five pages of first draft
    a week," which allowed his novel to flow from page to page.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.odysseyeditions.com/EBooks/Norman-Mailer/The-Naked-and-the-Dead/Author-commentary |title=The Naked and the Dead: Author commentary |first=Norman |last=Mailer |work=odysseyeditions.com |year=2015 |access-date=12 February 2015 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>
    Mailer felt this novel was the easiest for him to write, as he finished it quickly and passionately. He later stated, "Part of me thought it was possibly the greatest book written since ''[[War and Peace]]''."{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|xi}}
    Despite the author’s self-praise, he acknowledged his writing immaturity within the novel. Mailer insisted "it was sloppily written in many parts (the words came too quickly and too easily) and there was hardly a noun in any sentence that was not
    holding hands with the nearest and most commonly available adjective."{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|xi}}
    However, despite this criticism, Mailer believed the book deserved to be a best seller. It was written with vigor and contained acute descriptiveness which enabled readers to imagine what World War II was really like. Mailer admitted that he still
    returned to ''The Naked and the Dead'' occasionally and reread passages because they gave him hope “for all of us.”{{sfnp|Mailer|1948}}{{rp|xiii}}
    '''Character that represents Mailer:''' Mailer stated he did not portray himself as one of the characters. However, he mentions the character of Roth is the most similar to himself. He states Roth's experiences within the novel closely resembled his
    own experiences in WWII, especially in comparison to the other characters. This similarity is also evident in how they are both Jewish but don't necessarily strongly declare being Jewish. === "Fug" === The publishers of ''The Naked and the Dead''
    prevented Mailer from using the word "fuck" in his novel and had to use the [[euphemism]] "fug" instead. Mailer's version of a subsequent incident follows:
    <blockquote>The word has been a source of great embarrassment to me over the years because, you know, Tallulah Bankhead's press agent, many years ago, got a story in the papers which went..."Oh, hello, you're Norman Mailer," said Tallulah Bankhead
      allegedly, "You're the young man that doesn't know how to spell..." You know, the four-letter word was indicated with all sorts of asterisks.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Lennon |first1=Michael |last2=Mailer |first2=Norman |editor-last=Lennon |editor-first=J.

    </blockquote>
    The incident is mentioned in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s ''[[An Abundance of Katherines]]''. Colin Singleton tells Lindsey Lee Wells he likes to read literary criticism after reading a book. Colin says the publisher indicated that no one in
    1948 would buy ''The Naked and the Dead'' "'because it contains even more F-bombs than it does Regular Bombs.' So Norman Mailer, as a kind of fug-you to the publisher, went through his 872-page book and changed every last F-word to 'fug.'"

    [[Hartley Shawcross]] as [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] explained why he would not prosecute the book under the [[Obscene Publications Acts]]: "Whilst there is much in this most tedious and lengthy book which is foul, lewd and revolting,

    [[Tom Driberg]] welcomed the decision.<ref name="hansard1949"/>
    In its initial review the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' complained that the novel "grows increasingly unreadable" due to Mailer's tendency to "leave nothing out".<ref>Ross, Alan. "Under Fire." The Times Literary Supplement, 20 May 1949, p. 325.</ref>
    The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' described the novel as "dull" for the same reason.<ref>Johnson, Pamela Hansford. "New Fiction." Daily Telegraph, 13 May 1949, p. 6.</ref>
    Later, [[Gore Vidal]] would write:
    <blockquote>My first reaction to ''The Naked and the Dead'' was: it’s a fake. A clever, talented, admirably executed fake. I have not changed my opinion of the book since… I do recall a fine description of men carrying a dying man down a mountain…
      Yet every time I got going in the narrative I would find myself stopped cold by a set of made-up, predictable characters taken not from life, but from the same novels all of us had read, and informed by a naïveté which was at its worst when Mailer
      went into his Time-Machine and wrote those passages which resemble nothing so much as smudged carbons of a [[John Dos Passos|Dos Passos]] work.<ref>{{Citation |last=Vidal |first=Gore |author-link=Gore Vidal |orig-year=1960 |year=1993 |title=United States: Essays 1952–1992 |chapter=Norman Mailer’s Self-Advertisements |publisher=Random House |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/unitedstates00gore/page/32 32] |isbn=978-0-679-75572-2 |title-link=United States: Essays 1952–1992 }}</ref>

One of his most famous works, it tells the story of Santiago, an aging [[Cubans|Cuban]] [[fisherman]] who struggles with a giant [[marlin]] far out in the [[Gulf Stream]] off the coast of Cuba.<ref name="nobel">{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 | work = The Nobel Foundation | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1954/summary/ | access-date = March 23, 2020 }}</ref>

  ==Plot summary== Santiago is an aging, experienced fisherman who has gone eighty-four days without catching a fish. He is now seen as "''salao''," the worst form of unlucky. Manolin, a young man whom Santiago has trained since childhood, has been
  forced by his parents to work on a luckier boat. Manolin remains dedicated to Santiago, visiting his shack each night, hauling his fishing gear, preparing food, and talking about American baseball and Santiago's favorite player, [[Joe DiMaggio]].
  Santiago says that tomorrow, he will venture far out into the Gulf Stream, north of [[Cuba]] in the [[Straits of Florida]] to fish, confident that his unlucky streak is near its end. On the eighty-fifth day of his unlucky streak, Santiago takes his
  [[skiff]] out early. By noon, he has hooked a big fish that he is sure is a [[marlin]], but he is unable to haul it in. He is unwilling to tie the line to the boat for fear that a sudden jerk from the fish would break the line. With his back,
  shoulders, and hands, he holds the line for two days and nights. He gives slack as needed while the marlin pulls him far from land. He uses his other hooks to catch fish and a [[Mahi-mahi|dolphinfish]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The fish is referred to as a "dolphin," a common name for dolphinfish. Santiago identifies it as a dolphinfish when he calls it ''dorado'' (p. 73), not ''delfín''.}}
  to eat. The line cuts his hands, his body is sore, and he sleeps little. Despite this, he expresses compassion and appreciation for the marlin, often referring to him as a brother. He determines that no one is worthy enough to eat the marlin. On the
  third day, the fatigued marlin begins to circle the skiff. Santiago, almost delirious, draws the line inward, bringing the marlin towards the boat. He pulls the marlin onto its side and stabs it with a [[harpoon]], killing it. Seeing that the fish is
  too large to fit in the skiff, Santiago lashes it to the side of his boat. He sets sail for home, thinking of the high price the fish will bring him at the market and how many people he will feed. The trail of blood from the dead marlin attracts
  [[shark]]s. Santiago berates himself for having gone out too far. He kills a great [[mako shark]] with his harpoon but loses the weapon. He makes a spear by strapping his knife to the end of an [[oar]]. He kills three more sharks before the blade of
  the knife snaps, and he clubs two more sharks into submission. But each shark has bitten the great marlin, increasing the flow of blood. That night, an entire school of sharks arrives. Santiago attempts to beat them back. When the oar breaks,
  Santiago rips out the skiff's [[tiller]] and continues fighting. Upon seeing a shark attempt to eat the marlin's head, Santiago realizes the fish has been completely devoured. He tells the sharks they have killed his dreams. Santiago reaches shore
  before dawn the next day. He struggles to his shack, leaving the fish head and skeleton with his boat. Once home, he falls into a deep sleep. In the morning, Manolin finds Santiago. As he leaves to get coffee for Santiago, he cries. A group of
  fishermen have gathered around the remains of the marlin. One of them measures it at
  {{convert|18|ft|m}}
  from nose to tail. The fishermen tell Manolin to tell Santiago how sorry they are. A pair of tourists at a nearby café mistake the dead fish for a shark. When Santiago wakes, he donates the head of the fish to Pedrico. He and Manolin promise to fish
  together once again. Santiago returns to sleep, and he dreams of his youth and of lions on an African beach. ==Background and publication==

After going to sea at age ten on ships that called in African ports, he migrated permanently to Cuba when he was 22.

Hemingway at first planned to use Santiago's story, which became ''The Old Man and the Sea'', as part of an intimacy between mother and son. Relationships in the book relate to the [[Bible]], which he referred to as "The Sea Book". Some aspects of it
did appear in the posthumously published ''[[Islands in the Stream (Hemingway)|Islands in the Stream]]'' (1970). Hemingway mentions the real life experience of an old fisherman almost identical to that of Santiago and his marlin in ''On the Blue
Water: A Gulf Stream Letter'' (''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', April 1936).<ref>[http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Old-Man-And-The-Sea/Ernest-Hemingway/9780684830490#excerpt Old Man and the Sea.

Joseph Waldmeir's 1957 essay "''Confiteor Hominem'': Ernest Hemingway's Religion of Man" is a favorable critical reading of the novel—and one which has defined analytical considerations since. Perhaps the most memorable claim is Waldmeir's answer to
the question—What is the book's message?
<blockquote>The answer assumes a third level on which ''The Old Man and the Sea'' must be read—as a sort of allegorical commentary on all his previous work, by means of which it may be established that the religious overtones of ''The Old Man and the
  Sea'' are not peculiar to that book among Hemingway's works, and that Hemingway has finally taken the decisive step in elevating what might be called his philosophy of Manhood to the level of a religion.<ref name="waldmeir">{{cite journal | last = Joseph Waldmeir | title=''Confiteor Hominem'': Ernest Hemingway's Religion of Man | journal=Papers of the Michigan Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters | volume=XLII | year=1957 | pages=349–356 }}</ref></blockquote> Waldmeir considered the function of the novel's Christian imagery,{{or inline|date=May 2018}}
    most notably through Hemingway's reference to the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus|Christ]] following Santiago's sighting of the sharks that reads:
    <blockquote>"''Ay''," he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.<ref>Hemingway. ''The Old Man and the Sea''. p. 118</ref>
    </blockquote>
    One of the most outspoken critics of ''The Old Man and the Sea'' is Robert P. Weeks. His 1962 piece "Fakery in ''The Old Man and the Sea''" presents his argument that the novel is a weak and unexpected divergence from the typical, realistic Hemingway
    (referring to the rest of Hemingway's body of work as "earlier glories").<ref name="weeks"/>
    In juxtaposing this novel against Hemingway's previous works, Weeks contends:
    <blockquote>The difference, however, in the effectiveness with which Hemingway employs this characteristic device in his best work and in ''The Old Man and the Sea'' is illuminating. The work of fiction in which Hemingway devoted the most attention
      to natural objects, ''The Old Man and the Sea'', is pieced out with an extraordinary quantity of fakery, extraordinary because one would expect to find no inexactness, no romanticizing of natural objects in a writer who loathed [[W. H. Hudson]],
      could not read [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], deplored Melville's rhetoric in ''Moby Dick'', and who was himself criticized by other writers, notably Faulkner, for his devotion to the facts and his unwillingness to 'invent.'<ref name="weeks">{{cite journal | last1 = Robert P.

    ==Legacy== In 1954, Hemingway wanted to donate his Nobel Prize in Literature gold medal to the Cuban people. To avoid giving it to the [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] government, he donated it to the Catholic Church for display at the sanctuary at El
    Cobre, a small town outside [[Santiago de Cuba]] where the Marian image of [[Our Lady of Charity]] is located. The Swedish medal was stolen in the mid 1980s, but the police recovered it within a few days.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Miller |first1=Tom |title=Off The Shelf: The day Hemingway's Nobel Prize came out of hiding |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-caw-off-the-shelf4-2009oct04-story.html |access-date=6 June 2020 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=4 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/27/cubas-patron-saint-virgin-of-charity_n_1382971.html|title=Huffington Post|date=March 27, 2012|access-date=October 7, 2014}}</ref> ''The Old Man and the Sea'' has been adapted for the screen three times: a [[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|1958 film]] starring [[Spencer Tracy]], a [[The Old Man and the Sea (miniseries)|1990 miniseries]] starring [[Anthony Quinn]], and a [[The Old Man and the Sea (1999 film)|1999 animated short film]].

    ==Biography and publication== [[Gabriel García Márquez]] was one of the four [[Latin America]]n novelists first included in the literary [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s; the other three were the Peruvian [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], the
    Argentine [[Julio Cortázar]], and the Mexican [[Carlos Fuentes]]. ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' (1967) earned García Márquez international fame as a novelist of the [[magical realism]] movement within Latin American literature.<ref>"The Modern World". Web, www.themodernword.com/gabo/. April 17, 2010</ref>
    ==Plot== ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is the story of seven generations of the Buendía Family in the town of [[Macondo]]. The founding [[Patriarchy|patriarch]] of Macondo, José Arcadio Buendía, and Úrsula Iguarán, his wife (and first cousin),
    leave [[Riohacha]], [[Colombia]], after José Arcadio kills Prudencio Aguilar after a [[cockfight]] for suggesting José Arcadio was [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. One night of their emigration journey, while camping on a riverbank, José Arcadio
    dreams of "Macondo", a city of mirrors that reflected the world in and about it. Upon awakening, he decides to establish Macondo at the riverside; after days of wandering the jungle, his founding of Macondo is [[Utopia|utopic]].<ref name="Bell"/>
    José Arcadio Buendía believes Macondo to be surrounded by water, and from that island, he invents the world according to ''his'' perceptions.<ref name="Bell"/>
    Soon after its foundation, Macondo becomes a town frequented by unusual and extraordinary events that involve the generations of the Buendía family, who are unable or unwilling to escape their periodic (mostly self-inflicted) misfortunes. For years
    the town is solitary and unconnected to the outside world, with the exception of the annual visit of a band of gypsies, who show the townspeople technology such as [[magnet]]s, [[telescope]]s, and ice. The leader of the gypsies, a man named
    Melquíades, maintains a close friendship with José Arcadio, who becomes increasingly withdrawn, obsessed with investigating the mysteries of the universe presented to him by the gypsies. Ultimately he is driven insane, speaking only in
    [[Latin-language|Latin]], and is tied to a chestnut tree by his family for many years until his death. Eventually Macondo becomes exposed to the outside world and the government of newly independent Colombia. A rigged election between the [[Colombian
    Conservative Party|Conservative]] and [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal]] parties is held in town, inspiring Aureliano Buendía to join a civil war against the Conservative government. He becomes an iconic revolutionary leader, fighting for many years
    and surviving multiple attempts on his life, but ultimately tires of war and signs a peace treaty with the Conservatives. Disillusioned, he returns to Macondo and spends the rest of his life making tiny gold fish in his workshop. The railroad comes
    to Macondo, bringing in new technology and many foreign settlers. An American fruit company establishes a banana plantation outside the town, and builds its own segregated village across the river. This ushers in a period of prosperity that ends in
    tragedy as the Colombian army massacres thousands of striking plantation workers, an incident based on the [[Banana Massacre]] of 1928. José Arcadio Segundo, the only survivor of the massacre, finds no evidence of the massacre, and the surviving
    townspeople refuse to believe it happened. By the novel's end, Macondo has fallen into a decrepit and near-abandoned state, with the only remaining Buendías being Amaranta Úrsula and her nephew Aureliano, whose parentage is hidden by his grandmother
    Fernanda, and he and Amaranta Úrsula unknowingly begin an incestuous relationship. They have a child who bears the tail of a pig, fulfilling the lifelong fear of the long-dead matriarch Úrsula. Amaranta Úrsula dies in childbirth and the child is
    devoured by ants, leaving Aureliano as the last member of the family. He decodes an encryption Melquíades had left behind in a manuscript generations ago. The secret message informs the recipient of every fortune and misfortune that the Buendía
    family's generations lived through. As Aureliano reads the manuscript, he feels a windstorm starting around him, and he reads in the document that the Buendía family is doomed to be wiped from the face of the Earth because of it. In the last sentence
    of the book, the narrator describes Aureliano reading this last line just as the entire town of Macondo is scoured from existence.<ref name="Wood">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Michael|title=Gabriel García Márquez: One Hundred Years of Solitude|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-521-31692-8|author-link=Michael Wood (academic)}}</ref>
    [[File: One Hundred Years Of Solitude Buendia's Family Tree.svg|thumb|300px|The Buendia family tree.]] ==Symbolism and metaphors== A dominant theme in ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is the inevitable and inescapable repetition of history in
    Macondo. The protagonists are controlled by their pasts and the complexity of time. Throughout the novel the characters are visited by ghosts. "The ghosts are symbols of the past and the haunting nature it has over Macondo. The ghosts and the
    displaced repetition that they evoke are, in fact, firmly grounded in the particular development of Latin American history".<ref name="Erickson">{{cite book |title=Ghosts, Metaphor, and History in Toni Morrison's Beloved and Gabriel García Márquez's One Hundred Years off Solitude |last=Erickson |first=Daniel |year=2009 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-61348-5 }}</ref>
    "Ideological transfiguration ensured that Macondo and the Buendías always were ghosts to some extent, alienated and estranged from their own history, not only victims of the harsh reality of dependence and underdevelopment but also of the ideological
    illusions that haunt and reinforce such social conditions."<ref name="Erickson"/>
    The fate of Macondo is both doomed and predetermined from its very existence. "Fatalism is a metaphor for the particular part that ideology has played in maintaining historical dependence, by locking the interpretation of Latin American history into
    certain patterns that deny alternative possibilities. The narrative seemingly confirms fatalism in order to illustrate the feeling of entrapment that ideology can performatively create."<ref name="Erickson"/>
    García Márquez uses colours as symbols. Yellow and gold are the most frequently used and symbolize imperialism and the Spanish [[Siglo de Oro]]. Gold signifies a search for economic wealth, whereas yellow represents death, change, and destruction.<ref>Some Implications of Yellow and Gold in García Márquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude": Color Symbolism, Onomastics, and Anti-Idyll" by John Carson Pettey Citation Revista Hispánica Moderna, Año 53, No. 1 pp. 162–178 Year 2000</ref>
    The glass city is an image that comes to José Arcadio Buendía in a dream. It is the reason for Macondo's location, but also a symbol of its fate. Higgins writes, "By the final page, however, the city of mirrors has become a city of mirages. Macondo
    thus represents the dream of a brave new world that America seemed to promise and that was cruelly proved illusory by the subsequent course of history."<ref name="Bell"/>
    Images such as the glass city and the ice factory represent how Latin America already has its history outlined and is therefore fated for destruction.<ref name="Erickson"/>
    There is an underlying pattern of Latin American history in ''One Hundred Years of Solitude''. It has been said that the novel is one of a number of texts that "Latin American culture has created to understand itself."<ref name="Gonzalez Echevarria p. 358-80">"Cien años de soledad: the novel as myth and archive" by Gonzalez Echevarria. p. 358-80 Year 1984</ref>
    In this sense, the novel can be conceived as a linear archive that narrates the story of a Latin America discovered by European explorers, which had its historical entity developed by the printing press. The Archive is a symbol of the literature that

''Cien años de soledad.'' Barcelona: Editorial Vosgos, S.A., 1977.</ref> Buendía leaves [[Riohacha]], Colombia, along with his wife Úrsula Iguarán after being haunted by the corpse of Prudencio Aguilar (a man Buendía killed in a duel), who constantly bleeds from his wound and tries to wash it.<ref name="Gordo"/> One night while camping at the side of a river, Buendía dreams of a city of mirrors named Macondo and decides to establish the town in this location. José Arcadio Buendía is an introspective and inquisitive man of massive strength and energy who spends more time on his scientific pursuits than with his family. He flirts with alchemy and astronomy and becomes increasingly withdrawn from his family and community. ;'''Úrsula Iguarán''' Úrsula Iguarán is one of the two matriarchs of the Buendía family and is wife to José Arcadio Buendía.<ref name="Gordo"/> She lives to be well over 100 years old and she oversees the Buendía household through six of the seven generations documented in the novel. She exhibits a very strong character and often succeeds where the men of her family fail, for example finding a route to the outside world from Macondo. ===Second generation=== ;'''José Arcadio''' José Arcadio Buendía's firstborn son, José Arcadio seems to have inherited his father's headstrong, impulsive mannerisms.<ref name="Gordo"/> He eventually leaves the family to chase a Gypsy girl and unexpectedly returns many years later as an enormous man covered in tattoos, claiming that he has sailed the seas of the world. He marries his adopted sister Rebeca, causing his banishment from the mansion, and he dies from a mysterious gunshot wound, days after saving his brother from execution. ;'''Colonel Aureliano Buendía''' José Arcadio Buendía's second son and the first person to be born in Macondo.<ref name="Gordo"/> He was thought to have premonitions because everything he said came true.<ref name="Gordo"/> He represents not only a warrior figure but also an artist due to his ability to write poetry and create finely crafted golden fish. During the wars he fathered 17 sons by unknown women,<ref name="Gordo"/> all named Aureliano. Four of them later begin to live in Macondo, and in the span of several weeks all of them but one (including those who chose not to remain in Macondo) are murdered by unknown assassins, before any of them had reached thirty-five years of age. ;'''Remedios Moscote''' Remedios was the youngest daughter of the town's Conservative administrator, Don Apolinar Moscote.<ref name="Gordo"/> Her most striking physical features are her beautiful skin and her emerald-green eyes. The future Colonel Aureliano falls in love with her, despite her extreme youth. She dies shortly after the marriage from a blood poisoning illness during her pregnancy. Until soon before the Colonel's death, her dolls are displayed in his bedroom. ;'''Amaranta''' The third child of José Arcadio Buendía, Amaranta grows up as a companion of her adopted sister Rebeca.<ref name="Gordo"/> However, her feelings toward Rebeca turn sour over Pietro Crespi, whom both sisters intensely desire in their teenage years. Amaranta dies a lonely and virginal [[spinster]], but comfortable in her existence after having finally accepted what she had become.<ref name="Gordo"/> ;'''Rebeca''' Rebeca is the second cousin of Úrsula Iguaran and the orphaned child of Nicanor Ulloa and his wife Rebeca Montiel.<ref name="Gordo"/> At first she is extremely timid, refuses to speak, and has the habits of eating earth and whitewash from the walls of the house, a condition known as [[pica (disorder)|pica]]. She arrives carrying a canvas bag containing her parents' bones and seems not to understand or speak Spanish. However, she responds to questions asked by Visitación and Cataure in the Guajiro or [[Wayuu language]]. She falls in love with and marries her adoptive brother José Arcadio after his return from traveling the world. After his mysterious and untimely death, she lives in seclusion for the rest of her life. ===Third generation=== ;'''Arcadio''' Arcadio is José Arcadio's illegitimate son by Pilar Ternera.<ref name="Gordo"/> He is a schoolteacher who assumes leadership of Macondo after Colonel Aureliano Buendía leaves.<ref name="Gordo"/> He becomes a tyrannical dictator and uses his schoolchildren as his personal army and Macondo soon becomes subject to his whims. When the Liberal forces in Macondo fall, Arcadio is shot by a Conservative firing squad.<ref name="Gordo"/> ;'''Aureliano José''' Aureliano José is the illegitimate son of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and Pilar Ternera.<ref name="Gordo"/> He joins his father in several wars before deserting to return to Macondo upon hearing that it is possible to marry one's aunt. Aureliano José is obsessed with his aunt, Amaranta, who raised him since birth and who categorically rejects his advances. He is eventually shot to death by a Conservative captain midway through the wars.<ref name="Gordo"/> ;'''Santa Sofía de la Piedad''' Santa Sofía is a beautiful virgin girl and the daughter of a shopkeeper.<ref name="Gordo"/> She is hired by Pilar Ternera to have sex with her son Arcadio, her eventual husband.<ref name="Gordo"/> She is taken in along with her children by the Buendías after Arcadio's execution. After Úrsula's death she leaves unexpectedly, not knowing her destination. ;'''17 Aurelianos''' During his 32 civil war campaigns, Colonel Aureliano Buendía has 17 sons by 17 different women, each named after their father.<ref name="Gordo"/> Four of these Aurelianos (A. Triste, A. Serrador, A. Arcaya and A. Centeno) stay in Macondo and become a permanent part of the family. Eventually, as revenge against the Colonel, all are assassinated by the government, which identified them by the mysteriously permanent [[Ash Wednesday]] cross on their foreheads. The only survivor of the massacre is A. Amador, who escapes into the jungle only to be assassinated at the doorstep of his father's house many years later. ===Fourth generation=== {{anchor|Remedios-the-Beauty}}'''Remedios the Beauty'''<br/>Remedios the Beauty is Arcadio and Santa Sofía's first child.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      It is said she is the most beautiful woman ever seen in Macondo, and unintentionally causes the deaths of several men who love or lust over her.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come to think that she is mentally delayed. However, Colonel Aureliano Buendía believes she has inherited great lucidity: "It is as if she's come back from twenty years of war," he said.
      She rejects clothing and beauty. Too beautiful and, arguably, too wise for the world, Remedios ascends to heaven one afternoon, while folding Fernanda's white sheet. ;'''José Arcadio Segundo''' José Arcadio Segundo is the twin brother of Aureliano
      Segundo, the children of Arcadio and Santa Sofía.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      Úrsula believes that the two were switched in their childhood, as José Arcadio begins to show the characteristics of the family's Aurelianos, growing up to be pensive and quiet. He plays a major role in the banana worker strike, and is the only
      survivor when the company massacres the striking workers.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      Afterward, he spends the rest of his days studying the parchments of Melquíades, and tutoring the young Aureliano. He dies at the exact instant that his twin does.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      ;'''Aureliano Segundo''' Of the two brothers, Aureliano Segundo is the more boisterous and impulsive, much like the José Arcadios of the family.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      He takes his first girlfriend Petra Cotes as his mistress during his marriage to the beautiful and bitter Fernanda del Carpio.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      When living with Petra, his livestock propagate wildly, and he indulges in unrestrained revelry. After the long rains, his fortune dries up, and the Buendías are left almost penniless. He turns to a search for a buried treasure, which nearly drives
      him to insanity. He dies of an unknown throat illness at the same moment as his twin. During the confusion at the funeral, the bodies are switched, and each is buried in the other's grave (highlighting Úrsula's earlier comment that they had been
      switched at birth).
      {{anchor|Fernanda-del-Carpio}}'''Fernanda del Carpio'''<br/>Fernanda comes from a ruined, aristocratic family that kept her isolated from the world.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      She was chosen as the most beautiful of 5,000 girls. Fernanda is brought to Macondo to compete with Remedios for the title of Queen of the local carnival; however, her appearance turns the carnival into a bloody confrontation. After the fiasco, she
      marries Aureliano Segundo, who despite this maintains a domestic relation with his concubine, Petra Cotes. Nevertheless, she soon takes the leadership of the family away from the now-frail Úrsula. She manages the Buendía affairs with an iron fist.
      She has three children by Aureliano Segundo: José Arcadio; Renata Remedios, a.k.a. Meme; and Amaranta Úrsula. She remains in the house after her husband dies, taking care of the household until her death. Fernanda is never accepted by anyone in the
      Buendía household for they regard her as an outsider, although none of the Buendías rebel against her inflexible conservatism. Her mental and emotional instability is revealed through her paranoia, her correspondence with the "[[Psychic
      surgery|invisible doctors]]", and her irrational behavior towards Meme's son Aureliano, whom she tries to isolate from the whole world. ===Fifth generation=== ;'''Renata Remedios (a.k.a. Meme)''' Renata Remedios, or Meme is the second child and first
      daughter of Fernanda and Aureliano Segundo.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      While she doesn't inherit Fernanda's beauty, she does have Aureliano Segundo's love of life and natural charisma. After her mother declares that she is to do nothing but play the [[clavichord]], she is sent to school where she receives her
      performance degree as well as academic recognition. While she pursues the clavichord with “an inflexible discipline,” to placate Fernanda, she also enjoys partying and exhibits the same tendency towards excess as her father. Meme meets and falls in
      love with Mauricio Babilonia, but when Fernanda discovers their affair, she arranges for Mauricio to be shot, claiming that he was a chicken thief. She then takes Meme to a convent. Meme remains mute for the rest of her life, partially because of the
      trauma, but also as a sign of rebellion. Several months after arriving at the convent, she gives birth to a son, Aureliano. He is sent to live with the Buendías. Aureliano arrives in a basket and Fernanda is tempted to kill the child in order to
      avoid shame, but instead claims he is an orphan in order to cover up her daughter's promiscuity and is forced to "tolerate him against her will for the rest of her life because at the moment of truth she lacked the courage to go through with her
      inner determination to drown him". ;'''José Arcadio''' José Arcadio, named after his ancestors in the Buendía tradition, follows the trend of previous Arcadios.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      He is raised by Úrsula, who intends for him to become Pope. He returns from Rome without having become a priest. He spends his days pining for Amaranta, the object of his obsession. Eventually, he discovers the treasure Úrsula had buried under her
      bed, which he wastes on lavish parties and escapades with adolescent boys. Later, he begins a tentative friendship with Aureliano Babilonia, his nephew. José Arcadio plans to set Aureliano up in a business and return to Rome, but is murdered in his
      bath by four of the adolescent boys who ransack his house and steal his gold. ;'''Amaranta Úrsula''' Amaranta Úrsula is the third child of Fernanda and Aureliano.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      She displays the same characteristics as her namesake who dies when she is only a child.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      She never knows that the child sent to the Buendía home is her nephew, the illegitimate son of Meme. He becomes her best friend in childhood. She returns home from Europe with an older husband, Gastón, who leaves her when she informs him of her
      passionate affair with Aureliano. She dies of a [[hemorrhage]] after she has given birth to the last of the Buendía line.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      ===Sixth generation=== ;'''Aureliano Babilonia (Aureliano II)''' Aureliano Babilonia, or Aureliano II, is the illegitimate child of Meme. He is hidden from everyone by his grandmother, Fernanda. He is strikingly similar to his namesake, the Colonel,
      and has the same character patterns as well. He is taciturn, silent, and emotionally charged. He barely knows Úrsula, who dies during his childhood. He is a friend of José Arcadio Segundo, who explains to him the true story of the banana worker
      massacre. While other members of the family leave and return, Aureliano stays in the Buendía home. He only ventures into the empty town after the death of Fernanda. He works to decipher the parchments of Melquíades but stops to have an affair with
      his childhood partner and the love of his life, Amaranta Úrsula, not knowing that she is his aunt. When both she and her child die, he is able to decipher the parchments. "...Melquíades' final keys were revealed to him and he saw the epigraph of the
      parchments perfectly placed in the order of man's time and space: 'The first in line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants'." It is assumed he dies in the great wind that destroys Macondo the moment he finishes reading Melquíades'
      parchments. ===Seventh generation=== ;'''Aureliano''' Aureliano is the child of Aureliano and his aunt, Amaranta Úrsula.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      He is born with a pig's tail, as the eldest and long dead Úrsula had always feared would happen (the parents of the child had never heard of the omen).<ref name="Gordo"/>
      His mother dies after giving birth to him, and, due to his grief-stricken father's negligence, he is devoured by ants.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      ===Others=== ;'''Melquíades''' Melquíades is one of a band of gypsies who visit Macondo every year in March, displaying amazing items from around the world.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      Melquíades sells José Arcadio Buendía several new inventions including a pair of [[magnets]] and an [[alchemy|alchemist]]'s lab. Later, the gypsies report that Melquíades died in [[Singapore]], but he, nonetheless, returns to live with the Buendía
      family,<ref name="Gordo"/>
      stating he could not bear the solitude of death. He stays with the Buendías and begins to write the mysterious parchments, which are eventually translated by Aureliano Babilonia, and prophesy the House of Buendia's end. Melquíades dies a second time
      from drowning in the river near Macondo and, following a grand ceremony organized by the Buendías, is the first individual buried in Macondo. His name echoes [[Melchizedek]] in the Old Testament, whose source of authority as a high priest was
      mysterious. ;'''Pilar Ternera''' Pilar is a local woman who sleeps with the brothers Aureliano and José Arcadio.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      She becomes the mother of their sons, Aureliano José and Arcadio.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      Pilar reads the future with cards, and every so often makes an accurate, though vague, prediction.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      She has close ties with the Buendías throughout the whole novel, helping them with her card predictions. She dies some time after she turns 145 years old (she had eventually stopped counting),<ref name="Gordo"/>
      surviving until the last days of Macondo. She plays an integral part in the plot as she is the link between the second and the third generation of the Buendia family. The author highlights her importance by following her death with a declaratory "it
      was the end."<ref name="Gordo"/>
      ;'''Pietro Crespi''' Pietro is a very handsome and polite Italian musician who runs a music school.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      He installs the [[pianola]] in the Buendía house. He becomes engaged to Rebeca, but Amaranta, who also loves him, manages to delay the wedding for years. When José Arcadio and Rebeca agree to be married, Pietro begins to woo Amaranta, who is so
      embittered that she cruelly rejects him. Despondent over the loss of both sisters, he kills himself. ;'''Petra Cotes''' Petra is a dark-skinned woman with gold-brown eyes similar to those of a panther. She is Aureliano Segundo's mistress and the love
      of his life. She arrives in Macondo as a teenager with her first husband. After her husband dies, she begins a relationship with José Arcadio Segundo. When she meets Aureliano Segundo, she begins a relationship with him as well, not knowing they are
      two different men. After José Arcadio decides to leave her, Aureliano Segundo gets her forgiveness and remains by her side. He continues to see her, even after his marriage. He eventually lives with her, which greatly embitters his wife, Fernanda del
      Carpio. When Aureliano and Petra make love, their animals reproduce at an amazing rate, but their livestock is wiped out during the four years of rain. Petra makes money by keeping the lottery alive and provides food baskets for Fernanda and her
      family after the death of Aureliano Segundo. ;'''Mr. Herbert''' and '''Mr. Brown''' Mr. Herbert is a [[gringo]] who showed up at the Buendía house for lunch one day. After tasting the local bananas for the first time, he arranges for a banana company
      to set up a plantation in Macondo. The plantation is run by the dictatorial Jack Brown. When José Arcadio Segundo helps arrange a workers' strike on the plantation, the company traps the more than three thousand strikers and machine guns them down in
      the town square. The banana company and the government completely cover up the event. José Arcadio is the only one who remembers the slaughter. The company arranges for the army to kill off any resistance, then leaves Macondo for good. That event is
      likely based on the [[Banana massacre]], that took place in [[Ciénaga, Magdalena]] in 1928. ;'''Mauricio Babilonia''' Mauricio is a brutally honest, generous and handsome mechanic for the banana company.<ref name="Gordo"/>
      He is said to be a descendant of the gypsies who visit Macondo in the early days. He has the unusual characteristic of being constantly swarmed by yellow butterflies, which follow even his lover for a time. Mauricio begins a romantic affair with Meme
      until Fernanda discovers them and tries to end it. When Mauricio continues to sneak into the house to see her, Fernanda has him shot, claiming he is a chicken thief. Paralyzed and bedridden, he spends the rest of his long life in solitude.
      ;'''Gastón''' Gastón is Amaranta Úrsula's wealthy, Belgian husband. She marries him in Europe and returns to Macondo leading him on a silk leash. Gastón is about fifteen years older than his wife. He is an aviator and an adventurer. When he moves
      with Amaranta Ursula to Macondo he thinks it is only a matter of time before she realizes that her European ways are out of place, causing her to want to move back to Europe. However, when he realizes his wife intends to stay in Macondo, he arranges
      for his airplane to be shipped over so he can start an airmail service. The plane is shipped to Africa by mistake. When he travels there to claim it, Amaranta writes him of her love for Aureliano Babilonia Buendía. Gastón takes the news in stride,
      only asking that they ship him his [[velocipede]]. ;'''Colonel Gerineldo Marquez''' He is the friend and comrade-in-arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. He fruitlessly woos Amaranta. ;'''Gabriel Garcia Márquez''' Gabriel García Márquez is only a minor
      character in the novel but he has the distinction of bearing the same name as the author. He is the great-great-grandson of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. He and Aureliano Babilonia are close friends because they know the history of the town, which no
      one else believes. He leaves for Paris after winning a contest and decides to stay there, selling old newspapers and empty bottles. He is one of the few who is able to leave Macondo before the town is wiped out entirely. ==Major themes==

The term was coined by German art critic [[Franz Roh]] in 1925.<ref>Franz Roh: Nach-Expressionismus. Magischer Realismus. Probleme der neuesten europäischen Malerei. Klinkhardt & Biermann, Leipzig 1925.</ref> The novel presents a fictional story in a fictional setting. The extraordinary events and characters are fabricated. However, the message that García Márquez intends to deliver explains a true history. García Márquez uses his fantastic story as an expression of reality. "In ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' myth and history overlap. The myth acts as a vehicle to transmit history to the reader. García Márquez's novel can furthermore be referred to as anthropology, where truth is found in language and myth. What is real and what is fiction are indistinguishable. There are three main mythical elements of the novel: classical stories alluding to foundations and origins, characters resembling mythical heroes, and supernatural elements."<ref name="Gonzalez Echevarria p. 358-80"/> [[Magic realism]] is inherent in the novel—achieved by the constant intertwining of the ordinary with the extraordinary. This magic realism strikes at one's traditional sense of naturalistic fiction. There is something clearly magical about the world of Macondo. It is a state of mind as much as, or more than, a geographical place. For example, one learns very little about its actual physical layout. Furthermore, once in it, the reader must be prepared to meet whatever the imagination of the author presents to him or her.<ref>[http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/introser/marquez.HTM Ian Johnston (March 28, 1995) "On Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416051959/http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/introser/marquez.htm |date=April 16, 2016 }}, Malaspina University College (now Vancouver Island University), Canada</ref> García Márquez blends the real with the magical through the use of tone and narration. By maintaining the same tone throughout the novel, García Márquez makes the extraordinary blend with the ordinary. His condensation of and lackadaisical manner in describing events causes the extraordinary to seem less remarkable than it actually is, thereby perfectly blending the real with the magical.<ref>Gullon, Ricardo. "Review: Gabriel García Márquez & the Lost Art of Storytelling". ''Diacritics'', Vol. 1, No. 1 (Autumn, 1971), pp. 27–32.</ref> Reinforcing this effect is the unastonished tone in which the book is written. This tone restricts the ability of the reader to question the events of the novel. However, it also causes the reader to call into question the limits of reality.<ref name="Wood"/> Furthermore, maintaining the same narrator throughout the novel familiarizes the reader with his voice and causes him or her to become accustomed to the extraordinary events in the novel.<ref name="Wood"/> Throughout the novel, García Márquez is said to have a gift for blending the everyday with the miraculous, the historical with the fabulous, and psychological realism with surreal flights of fancy. It is a revolutionary novel that provides a looking glass into the thoughts and beliefs of its author, who chose to give a literary voice to Latin America: "A Latin America which neither wants, nor has any reason, to be a pawn without a will of its own; nor is it merely wishful thinking that its quest for independence and originality should become a Western aspiration."<ref>''The Dialectics of our America: Genealogy, Cultural Critique, and Literary History Post-Contemporary Interventions'', by José David Saldívar, Duke University Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8223-1169-0}}, pg. 21</ref> Although we are faced with a very convoluted narrative, García Márquez is able to define clear themes while maintaining individual character identities, and using different narrative techniques such as [[third-person narrator]]s, specific point of view narrators, and [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|streams of consciousness]]. Cinematographic techniques are also employed in the novel, with the idea of the [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] and the [[close-up]], which effectively combine the comic and grotesque with the dramatic and tragic. Furthermore, political and historical realities are combined with the mythical and magical Latin American world. Lastly, through human comedy the problems of a family, a town, and a country are unveiled. This is all presented through García Márquez's unique form of narration, which causes the novel to never cease being at its most interesting point.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The characters in the novel are never defined; they are not created from a mold. Instead, they are developed and formed throughout the novel. All characters are individualized, with many characteristics that differentiate them from others.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Ultimately, the novel has a rich imagination achieved by its rhythmic tone, narrative technique, and fascinating character creation, making it a thematic quarry, where the trivial and anecdotal and the historic and political are combined.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> ===Solitude=== − Perhaps the most dominant theme in the book is that of solitude. Macondo was founded in the remote jungles of the Colombian rainforest. The solitude of the town is representative of the colonial period in Latin American history, where outposts and colonies were, for all intents and purposes, not interconnected.<ref name="Bell"/> Isolated from the rest of the world, the Buendías grow to be increasingly solitary and selfish. With every member of the family living only for him or her self, the Buendías become representative of the aristocratic, land-owning elite who came to dominate Latin America in keeping with the sense of Latin American history symbolized in the novel.<ref name="Bell"/> This egocentricity is embodied, especially, in the characters of Aureliano, who lives in a private world of his own, and Remedios the Beauty, who innocently destroys the lives of four men enamored by her unbelievable beauty, because she is living in a different reality due to what some see as autism.<ref name="Bell"/> Throughout the novel it seems as if no character can find true love or escape the destructiveness of their own egocentricity.<ref name="Bell"/> The selfishness of the Buendía family is eventually broken by the once superficial Aureliano Segundo and Petra Cotes, who discover a sense of mutual solidarity and the joy of helping others in need during Macondo's economic crisis.<ref name="Bell"/> The pair even find love, and their pattern is repeated by Aureliano Babilonia and Amaranta Úrsula.<ref name="Bell"/> Eventually, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula have a child, and the latter is convinced that it will represent a fresh start for the once-conceited Buendía family.<ref name="Bell"/> However, the child turns out to be the perpetually feared monster with the pig's tail. Nonetheless, the appearance of love represents a shift in Macondo, albeit one that leads to its destruction. "The emergence of love in the novel to displace the traditional egoism of the Buendías reflects the emergence of socialist values as a political force in Latin America, a force that will sweep away the Buendías and the order they represent."<ref name="Bell"/> The ending to ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' could be a wishful prediction by García Márquez, a well-known socialist, regarding the future of Latin America.<ref name="Bell"/> ===Fluidity of time=== ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' contains several ideas concerning time. Although the story can be read as a linear progression of events, both when considering individual lives and Macondo's history, García Márquez allows room for several other interpretations of time: * He reiterates the metaphor of history as a circular phenomenon through the repetition of names and characteristics belonging to the Buendía family.<ref>One Hundred Years of Solitude, Encyclopedia Beta.</ref> Over six generations, all the José Arcadios possess inquisitive and rational dispositions as well as enormous physical strength. The Aurelianos, meanwhile, lean towards insularity and quietude. This repetition of traits reproduces the history of the individual characters and, ultimately, a history of the town as a succession of the same mistakes [[ad infinitum]] due to some endogenous [[hubris]] in our nature. * The novel explores the issue of timelessness or eternity even within the framework of mortal existence. A major [[Trope (literature)|trope]] with which it accomplishes this task is the alchemist's laboratory in the Buendía family home. The laboratory was first designed by Melquíades near the start of the story and remains essentially unchanged throughout its course. It is a place where the male Buendía characters can indulge their will to solitude, whether through attempts to deconstruct the world with reason as in the case of José Arcadio Buendía, or by the endless creation and destruction of golden fish as in the case of his son Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Furthermore, a sense of inevitability prevails throughout the text. This is a feeling that regardless of what way one looks at time, its encompassing nature is the one truthful admission. * On the other hand, it is important to keep in mind that ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', while basically chronological and "linear" enough in its broad outlines, also shows abundant zigzags in time, both flashbacks of matters past and long leaps towards future events. One example of this is the youthful amour between Meme and Mauricio Babilonia, which is already in full swing before we are informed about the origins of the affair.<ref name="Bell"/> ===Incest=== A recurring theme in ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is the Buendía family's propensity toward [[incest]]. The patriarch of the family, Jose Arcadio Buendía, is the first of numerous Buendías to intermarry when he marries his first cousin, Úrsula. Furthermore, the fact that "throughout the novel the family is haunted by the fear of punishment in the form of the birth of a monstrous child with a pig's tail"<ref name="Bell"/> can be attributed to this initial act and the recurring acts of incest among the Buendías.<ref name="Bell"/> ===Elitism=== A theme throughout ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is the [[elitism]] of the Buendía family. Gabriel García Márquez shows his criticism of the Latin American elite through the stories of the members a high-status family who are essentially in love with themselves, to the point of being unable to understand the mistakes of their past and learn from them.<ref name=":0">Elsey, Brenda. “One Hundred Years of Solitude.” History of Latin America 1810-Present.

García Márquez also received an honorary LL.D. from [[Columbia University]] in New York City. These awards set the stage for García Márquez's 1982 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. The novel topped the list of books that have most shaped world literature over the last 25 years, according to a survey of international writers commissioned by the global literary journal ''[[Wasafiri]]'' as a part of its 25<small>th</small>-anniversary celebration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wasafiri.org/pages/news_01/news_item.asp?News_01ID=182 |title="25 acclaimed international writers choose 25 of the best books from the last 25 years" (September 25, 2009) ''Wasafiri Magazine'' |access-date=October 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005175839/http://www.wasafiri.org/pages/news_01/news_item.asp?News_01ID=182 |archive-date=October 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The superlatives from reviewers and readers alike display the resounding praise which the novel has received. [[Chilean people|Chilean]] poet and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Laureate]] [[Pablo Neruda]] called it "the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since ''[[Don Quixote]]'' of [[Cervantes]]", while [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that "with a single bound, Gabriel García Márquez leaps onto the stage with [[Günter Grass]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]]."<ref name = "PSinsights" /> According to Antonio Sacoto, professor at the [[City College of the City University of New York]], ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is considered one of the five key novels in Hispanic American literature (together with ''[[El Señor Presidente]]'', ''[[Pedro Páramo]]'', ''[[The Death of Artemio Cruz|La Muerte de Artemio Cruz]]'', and ''[[La ciudad y los perros]]''). These novels, representative of the boom allowed Hispanic American literature to reach the quality of North American and European literature in terms of technical quality, rich themes, and linguistic innovations, among other attributes.<ref name="ReferenceB">Antonio Sacoto (1979) ''Cinco novelas claves de la novela hispano americana'' (''[[El señor presidente]]'', ''[[Pedro Páramo]]'', ''[[La muerte de Artemio Cruz]]'', ''[[La ciudad y los perros]]'', ''Cien años de soledad''), Eliseo Torres & Sons, New York</ref> In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, García Márquez addressed the significance of his writing and proposed its role to be more than just literary expression: {{quote|I dare to think that it is this outsized reality, and not just its literary expression, that has deserved the attention of the Swedish Academy of Letters. A reality not of paper, but one that lives within us and determines each instant of our countless daily deaths, and that nourishes a source of insatiable creativity, full of sorrow and beauty, of which this roving and nostalgic Colombian is but one cipher more, singled out by fortune. Poets and beggars, musicians and prophets, warriors and scoundrels, all creatures of that unbridled reality, we have had to ask but little of imagination, for our crucial problem has been a lack of conventional means to render our lives believable. This, my friends, is the crux of our solitude.<ref>Marquez, Gabriel Garcia. Nobel Lecture, Hispanic Heritage in the Americas. Nobel Lecture, 8 December 1982</ref>}} [[Harold Bloom]] remarked, "My primary impression, in the act of rereading ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', is a kind of aesthetic battle fatigue, since every page is rammed full of life beyond the capacity of any single reader to absorb... There are no wasted sentences, no mere transitions, in this novel, and you must notice everything at the moment you read it."<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Bloom's Critical Interpretations'': Edited and with an Introduction by Harold Bloom: "Gabriel García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude". Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2003</ref> [[David Haberly]] has argued that García Márquez may have borrowed themes from several works, such as [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Yoknapatawpha County]], [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'', [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]]'s ''[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]'', and [[Chateaubriand]]'s ''[[Atala (novella)|Atala]]'', in an example of [[intertextuality]].<ref>Haberly, David T. (1990) ''Bags of Bones: A Source for Cien Años de Soledad'', The Johns Hopkins University Press</ref> === Relation to Colombian history === As a metaphoric, critical interpretation of Colombian history, from foundation to contemporary nation, ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' presents different [[national myth]]s through the story of the Buendía family,<ref name="McMurray, George 1969 pp. 175-181" /> whose spirit of adventure places them amidst the important actions of Colombian historical events. These events include the inclusion of the Roma "Gypsies", the Liberal political reformation of a colonial way of life, and the 19th-century arguments for and against it; the arrival of the railway to a mountainous country; the [[Thousand Days' War]] (Guerra de los Mil Días, 1899–1902); the corporate [[hegemony]] of the [[United Fruit Company]] ("American Fruit Company" in the story); the [[film|cinema]]; the [[automobile]]; and the [[Banana massacre|military massacre of striking workers]] as government–labour relations policy.<ref name="Wood" /> ==== Inclusion of the Roma ("Gypsies") ==== According to Hazel Marsh, a Senior Lecturer in Latin American Studies at the [[University of East Anglia]], it is estimated that 8,000 [[Romani Colombians|Roma]] live in [[Colombia]] today. However, “most South American history books...exclude the presence of the Roma.”<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Roma Gypsies of Colombia {{!}}
      Latino Life|url=https://www.latinolife.co.uk/node/289|access-date=2021-03-24|website=www.latinolife.co.uk}}</ref>
    ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' differs from this tendency by including the traveling Roma throughout the story. Led by a man named Melquíades, the Roma bring new discoveries and technology to the isolated village of Macondo, often inciting the
    curiosity of José Arcadio Buendía. ==== Depiction of the Thousand Days War ==== [[Thousand Days' War|The Thousand Days War]] in [[Colombia]] was fought between [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberals]] and [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservatives]]
    between 1899 - 1902. The Conservatives had been "in control more or less constantly since 1867," and the Liberals, mainly coffee plantation owners and workers who had been excluded from representation, sparked a revolution in October 1899.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Minster|first=Christopher|date=January 2, 2020|title=The Thousand Days' War|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-thousand-days-war-2136356|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-24|website=www.thoughtco.com}}</ref> The fighting continued for a few years, and it is estimated that over 130,000 lives were lost. In Chapters 5 and 6 of ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', the Conservative Army has invaded the town of Macondo leading Aureliano to eventually lead a rebellion. The rebellion is successful - the Conservative Army falls - and afterward, Aureliano, now 'Colonel Aureliano Buendía' decides to continue fighting. He departs Macondo with the band of people who helped him oust the Conservative Army to go continue fighting elsewhere for the Liberal side. Because Macondo is a fictional town created by [[Gabriel García Márquez]], the exact events of the [[Thousand Days' War]] as they occurred in the book are fictional. However, these events are widely considered to be metaphorical for the Thousand Days War as experienced by the entire country of [[Colombia]]. ==== Representation of the "Banana Massacre" ==== The “[[Banana Massacre]]” occurred between December 5 and 6 of 1928 in [[Ciénega, Boyacá|Ciénaga]] near [[Santa Marta|Santa Marta, Colombia]]. Banana plantation workers had been striking against the [[United Fruit Company]] to earn better labor conditions when members of the local military fired guns into crowds.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Caro|first=Jorge Enrique Elías|date=2012|title=The worker's massacre of 1928 in the Magdalena Zona Bananera - Colombia. An unfinished story|url=http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/memor/n18/n18a03.pdf|journal=Revista digital de Historia y Arqueología desde el Caribe colombiano|via=Memorias}}</ref> This event, which occurs in Chapter 15 of ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', was depicted with relative accuracy, minus a false sense of certainty about the specific facts surrounding the events. For instance, although Marquez writes that there must have been “three thousand...dead,” the true number of victims is unknown. However, the number likely was not far off, because it is considered that the “number of killings was over a thousand,” according to Dr. Jorge Enrique Elias Caro and Dr. Antonino Vidal Ortega.<ref name=":3" /> The lack of information surrounding the “Banana Massacre” is thought to be largely due to the “manipulation of the information as registered by the Colombian Government and the United Fruit Company.”<ref name=":3" /> ==Internal references== In the novel's account of the civil war and subsequent peace, there are numerous mentions of the pensions not arriving for the veterans, a reference to one of García Márquez's earlier works, ''El coronel no tiene quien le escriba''. In the novel's final chapter, García Márquez refers to the novel ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortázar novel)|Hopscotch]]'' (Spanish: ''Rayuela'') by [[Julio Cortázar]] in the following line: "...in the room that smelled of boiled cauliflower where Rocamadour was to die" (p.&nbsp;412). Rocamadour is a fictional character in ''Hopscotch'' who indeed dies in the room described. He also refers to two other major works by Latin American writers in the novel: ''[[The Death of Artemio Cruz]]'' (Spanish: ''La Muerte de Artemio Cruz'') by Carlos Fuentes and ''[[Explosion in a Cathedral]]'' (Spanish: ''El siglo de las luces'') by [[Alejo Carpentier]]. ==Adaptations== While ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' has had a large effect on the literary world and is the author's best-selling and most translated work, there have been no movies produced of it as García Márquez never agreed to sell the rights to produce such a film. On March 6, 2019, García Márquez's son Rodrigo García Barcha, announced that [[Netflix]] was developing a series based upon the book with a set release in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eltiempo.com/cultura/cine-y-tv/netflix-hara-una-serie-de-la-novela-cien-anos-de-soledad-de-gabriel-garcia-marquez-334516 |date=March 6, 2019 |access-date=6 March 2019 |title='Cien años de soledad' se convertirá en una serie de Netflix |last=Hoyos Vargas |first=Andrés |website=El Tiempo |language=es}}</ref>

        '''''The Hunchback of Notre-Dame''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Notre-Dame de Paris'''|translation=''Our Lady of Paris''}}, originally titled '''''Notre-Dame de Paris. 1482''''') is a [[19th-century French literature|French]] [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] [[novel]]
          by [[Victor Hugo]], published in [[1831 in literature|1831]]. The novel has been described as a key text in French literature<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hunchback of Notre-Dame: Victor Hugo's classic novel shoots up Amazon sales following cathedral fire |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/the-hunchback-of-notre-dame-victor-hugo-amazon-cathedral-fire-a8873131.html |work=The Independent|date=16 April 2019 }}</ref> and has been adapted for film over a dozen times, in addition to numerous television and stage adaptations, such as [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|a 1923 silent film]] with [[Lon Chaney]], [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|a 1939 sound film]] with [[Charles Laughton]], and [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|a 1996 Disney animated film]] with [[Tom Hulce]]. The novel sought to preserve values of French culture in a time period of great change, which resulted in the destruction of many [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] structures and threatened to trivialise the vibrancy of [[France in the Middle Ages|15th century France]]. The novel made [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] a national icon and served as a catalyst for renewed interest in the restoration of Gothic form.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Hunchback of Notre Dame {{!}} Summary, Characters, Book, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame|access-date=2020-10-16|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> ==Title== The novel's original French title, ''Notre-Dame de Paris'', refers to [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]], on which the story is centered. [[Frederic Shoberl]]'s 1833 English translation was published as ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' (which became the generally used title in English), referring to [[Quasimodo]], Notre Dame's [[bell-ringer]]. == Background == [[File:Victor Hugo-Hunchback.jpg|thumb|Illustration from<br />''Victor Hugo et son temps'' (1881)]] Victor Hugo began writing ''Notre-Dame de Paris'' in 1829, largely to make his contemporaries more aware of the value of the Gothic architecture, which was neglected and often destroyed to be replaced by new buildings or defaced by replacement of parts of buildings in a newer style. For instance, the medieval stained glass panels of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] had been replaced by white glass to let more light into the church.<ref>[[:fr:Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris]]</ref> This explains the large descriptive sections of the book, which far exceed the requirements of the story. A few years earlier, Hugo had already published a paper entitled ''Guerre aux Démolisseurs'' (''War to the Demolishers'') specifically aimed at saving Paris' medieval architecture.<ref>[[:fr:Notre-Dame de Paris (roman)#cite note-21]]</ref> The agreement with his original publisher, Gosselin, was that the book would be finished that same year, but Hugo was constantly delayed due to the demands of other projects. In the summer of 1830, Gosselin demanded that Hugo complete the book by February 1831. Beginning in September 1830, Hugo worked nonstop on the project thereafter. ==Characters== ===Major=== * [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda]] (born Agnes) is a beautiful 16-year-old Romani street dancer who is naturally compassionate and kind. She is the novel's protagonist and the center of the human drama within the story. A popular focus of the citizens' attentions, she is the recipient of their changing attitudes, being first adored as an entertainer, then hated as a witch, before being lauded again by Quasimodo. She is loved by Quasimodo, Pierre Gringoire, and Claude Frollo, but, unfortunately she falls hopelessly in love with Captain Phoebus, a handsome soldier who she believes will rightly protect her but who in reality simply wants to seduce her. She is one of the few characters to show Quasimodo a measure of human kindness, as when she gives him water after his flogging. She is eventually revealed to be not a Romani by birth but to have been kidnapped by them and replaced by the deformed Quasimodo. * [[Claude Frollo]], the novel's main antagonist, is the Archdeacon of Notre Dame. His sour attitude and alchemical experiments have alienated him from Parisians, who believe him to be a sorcerer. His only surviving relative is his dissolute younger brother Jehan, whom he unsuccessfully attempts to reform. Frollo also helps care for Quasimodo. Frollo's numerous sins include lechery, failed alchemy, and other listed vices. His mad attraction to Esmeralda sets off a chain of events, including her attempted abduction, leading to Quasimodo's lashing in the square, and Frollo nearly murdering Phoebus in a jealous rage, leading to Esmeralda's execution. * [[Quasimodo]] is a deformed 20-year-old [[Kyphosis|hunchback]], and the bell-ringer of Notre Dame. He is half blind and deaf, the latter from all the years ringing [[Bells of Notre-Dame de Paris|the bells of the church]]. Abandoned by his mother as a baby, he was adopted by Claude Frollo. Quasimodo's life within the confines of the cathedral and his only two outlets —ringing the bells and his love and devotion for Frollo—are described. He rarely ventures outside the Cathedral because the citizens of Paris despise and shun him for his appearance. The notable occasions when he does leave include taking part in the [[Feast of Fools|Festival of Fools]] (which is celebrated on January 6)—during which he is elected the Pope of Fools due to his perfect hideousness—and his subsequent attempt to kidnap Esmeralda, his rescue of Esmeralda from the gallows, his attempt to bring Phoebus to Esmeralda, and his final abandonment of the cathedral at the end of the novel. It is revealed in the story that the baby Quasimodo was left by the [[Romani people|Roma]] in place of Esmeralda, whom they abducted. * [[Pierre Gringoire]] is a struggling poet. He mistakenly finds his way into the "[[Cour des miracles|Court of Miracles]]", the domain of the Truands (beggars). In order to preserve the secrecy, Gringoire must either be killed by hanging or marry a Romani. Although Esmeralda does not love him, and in fact believes him to be a coward rather than a true man, she takes pity on his plight and marries him. Touched by her beauty and kindness, Gringoire falls in love with her. But, because she is already in love with Phoebus, much to his disappointment, she will not let him touch her. As time goes on, he grows more fond of Esmeralda's goat Djali than Esmeralda herself, so much so that when he chooses to save Djali rather than Esmeralda when Frollo and his guards pursue, it leads to her kidnapping and eventual hanging. * [[Captain Phoebus]] is the Captain of the King's Archers, and a minor antagonist in the novel. After he saves Esmeralda from abduction, she becomes infatuated with him, and he is intrigued by her. Already betrothed to the beautiful but spiteful Fleur-de-Lys, he wants to seduce Esmeralda nonetheless but is prevented when Frollo stabs him. Phoebus survives, but Esmeralda is taken to be the attempted assassin by all, including Phoebus himself, who no longer wants her. He is condemned to an unhappy married life with Fleur-de-Lys. ===Minor=== * [[Clopin Trouillefou]] is the King of Truands. He sentences Gringoire to be hanged, and presides over his "wedding" to Esmeralda. He rallies the Court of Miracles to rescue Esmeralda from Notre Dame after the idea is suggested by Gringoire. He is eventually killed during the attack by the King's soldiers. * [[Duke]] of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egypt]] is Esmeralda's protector and second-in-command of the Truands. He knows of her past and gave her an amulet to help find her mother. He is last seen during the riot at Notre Dame to rescue Esmeralda. * [[Jehan Frollo]] ''du Moulin'' (literally "of the mill"), translated in [[Latin]] as "Joannes Frollo ''de Molendino''", is Claude Frollo's 16-year-old dissolute younger brother. He is a troublemaker and a student at the university. He is dependent on his brother for money, which he then proceeds to squander on alcohol. After his brother stops giving him money, Jehan becomes rogue. When he joins Clopin and his beggars to raid the cathedral, he briefly enters the cathedral by ascending one of the towers with a borrowed ladder. Afterwards he sees Quasimodo and tries to shoot an arrow at the hunchback's eye, but Quasimodo throws him to his death. * [[Fleur-de-lis|Fleur-de-Lys]] de Gondelaurier is a beautiful and wealthy noblewoman engaged to Phoebus. Phoebus's attentions to Esmeralda make her insecure and jealous, and she and her friends respond by treating Esmeralda with contempt and spite. Fleur-de-Lys later neglects to inform Phoebus that Esmeralda has not been executed, which serves to deprive the pair of any further contact—though as Phoebus no longer lusts after Esmeralda by this time, this does not matter. The novel ends with their wedding, but they are said to be condemned to an unhappy marriage. * Madame Aloïse de Gondelaurier is Fleur-de-Lys' mother. * Sister Gudule, also known as Sachette and formerly named Paquette Guybertaut "''la Chantefleurie''", is an [[anchorite|anchoress]] living in seclusion in an exposed cell in central Paris. She is tormented by the loss of her daughter Agnes, whom she believes to have been cannibalised by the Roma as a baby, and devotes her life to mourning her. Her long-lost daughter turns out to be Esmeralda, a fact she discovers only moments before Esmeralda is hanged. Gudule is accidentally killed by one of the King's soldiers while attempting to prevent them from taking her daughter. * Djali is Esmeralda's pet goat. In addition to dancing with Esmeralda, Djali can do tricks for money, such as tell time, spell Phoebus' name, and do impressions of public figures. Later, during Esmeralda's trial, when Esmeralda is falsely accused of stabbing Phoebus, Djali is falsely accused of being the devil in disguise. At the end of the novel, Djali is saved by Gringoire (who has become fond of the goat during his marriage to Esmeralda) after Esmeralda is captured and hanged. * [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] is the King of France. He appears as an old and sick man, but his personality is very sly and Machiavellian, as well as self-centred. He appears briefly when he is brought the news of the rioting at Notre Dame. He orders his guard to kill the rioters, and also the "witch" Esmeralda, because of being misinformed about the reason of rioting. * [[Tristan l'Hermite]] is a friend of King Louis XI. He leads the band that goes to capture Esmeralda. * Henriet Cousin is the city executioner, who hangs Esmeralda. * Florian Barbedienne is the judge who presides over Quasimodo's case for kidnapping Esmeralda. He is also deaf, which makes it more difficult because when he asks Quasimodo for his name, age and profession, Quasimodo does not respond. He sentences the hunchback to be tortured in the public square: one hour of flogging for attempted kidnap, and another hour of public disgrace after he thought Quasimodo was mocking him. * Jacques Charmolue is Claude Frollo's friend in charge of torturing prisoners. He gets Esmeralda to falsely confess to killing Phoebus. He then has her imprisoned. * Jacques Coppenole is a man who appears in the beginning of the novel as one of the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] guests at the Feast of Fools. He convinces the Parisians to select the Pope of Fools. * Pierrat Torterue is the torturer at the Châtelet.

He is also the official who administered the savage flogging that Quasimodo was sentenced to by Barbedienne. * The unnamed [[magistrate]] is the one who presides over Esmeralda's case after she is falsely accused of stabbing Phoebus.

The beautiful [[Romani people|Romani woman]] Esmeralda (born as Agnes) is the romantic and sexual interest of many men, including [[Captain Phoebus]] and [[Pierre Gringoire]], but especially [[Quasimodo]] and his guardian [[Archdeacon]] [[Claude Frollo]]. Frollo is torn between his obsessive lust for Esmeralda and the rules of Notre Dame Cathedral. He orders Quasimodo to kidnap her, but Quasimodo is captured by Phoebus and his guards, who save Esmeralda. Gringoire, who attempted to help Esmeralda but was knocked out by Quasimodo, is about to be hanged by beggars when Esmeralda saves him by agreeing to marry him for four years. The following day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be flogged and turned on the [[pillory]] for two hours, followed by another hour's public exposure. He calls for water. Esmeralda, seeing his thirst, approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him, and she captures his heart. Later, Esmeralda is arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Phoebus, whom Frollo attempted to kill in jealousy after seeing him trying to seduce Esmeralda. She is sentenced to death by hanging. As she is being led to the [[gallows]], Quasimodo swings down by the bell rope of Notre-Dame and carries her off to the cathedral, temporarily protecting her – under the [[Right of asylum|law of sanctuary]] – from arrest. Frollo later informs Gringoire that the [[Parlement of Paris|Court of Parlement]] has voted to remove Esmeralda's right to the sanctuary so she can no longer seek shelter in the cathedral and will be taken away to be killed. Clopin, the leader of the Roma, hears the news from Gringoire and rallies the citizens of Paris to charge the cathedral and rescue Esmeralda. When Quasimodo sees the Roma, he assumes they are there to hurt Esmeralda, so he drives them off. Likewise, he thinks the king's men want to rescue her, and tries to help them find her. She is rescued by Frollo and Gringoire. But after yet another failed attempt to win her love, Frollo betrays Esmeralda by handing her to the troops and watches while she is being hanged. When Frollo laughs during Esmeralda's hanging, Quasimodo pushes him from the height of Notre Dame to his death. With nothing left to live for, Quasimodo vanishes and is never seen again. In the original, Quasimodo's skeleton is found many years later in the [[charnel house]], a mass grave into which the bodies of the destitute and criminals were indiscriminately thrown, implying that Quasimodo had sought Esmeralda among the decaying corpses and lay beside her, letting himself slowly die while holding her. As the guards attempt to pull the embracing skeletons apart, his skeleton crumbles to dust. ==Major themes== {{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}
          The novel's original French title, ''Notre-Dame de Paris'', indicates that the cathedral itself is the most significant aspect of the novel, both the main setting and the focus of the story's themes.<ref>Zaretsky, Rob. [http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2293.htm "Victor Hugo and Architecture"], ''Engines of our Ingenuity'', 2006 radio transcript, University of Houston. Accessed 2 June 2016.</ref>
          The building had fallen into disrepair at the time of writing, which was something Hugo felt strongly about. The book portrays the [[Romantic fiction|Romantic]] era as one of extremes in architecture, passion, and religion.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
          The theme of [[determinism]] (fate and destiny, as set up in the preface of the novel through the introduction of the word "[[Ananke (mythology)|ANANKE]]") is explored, as well as revolution and social strife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/section13.rhtml |title=Sparknotes.com |publisher=Sparknotes.com |access-date=31 May 2011}}</ref>
          ===Architecture=== Architecture is a major concern of Hugo's in ''Notre-Dame de Paris'', not just as embodied in the cathedral itself, but as representing throughout Paris and the rest of Europe an artistic genre which, Hugo argued, was about to
          disappear with the arrival of the printing press. Claude Frollo's portentous phrase, '{{lang|fr|Ceci tuera cela}}' ("This will kill that", as he looks from a printed book to the cathedral building), sums up this thesis, which is expounded on in Book V, chapter 2. Hugo writes that '{{lang|fr|quiconque naissant poète se faisait architecte}}' ("whoever was born a poet became an architect"), arguing that while the written word was heavily censored and difficult to reproduce, architecture was extremely prominent and enjoyed considerable freedom.
          {{Verse translation|lang=fr|Il existe à cette époque, pour la pensée écrite en pierre, un privilège tout-à-fait comparable à notre liberté actuelle de la presse. C'est la liberté de l'architecture. | There exists in this era, for thoughts written in stone, a privilege comparable to our current freedom of the press. It is the freedom of architecture.|attr1=Book V, Chapter 2}}
          With the recent introduction of the printing press, it became possible to reproduce one's ideas much more easily on paper, and Hugo considered this period to represent the last flowering of architecture as a great art form. As with many of his books,
          Hugo was interested in a time that seemed to him to be on the cusp of two types of society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/victor_hugo/hunchback_notre_dame/24/ |title=Online-literature.com |publisher=Online-literature.com |date=26 January 2007 |access-date=31 May 2011}}</ref>
          The major theme of the third book is that over time the cathedral has been repaired, but the repairs and additions have made the cathedral worse: "And who put the cold, white panes in the place of those windows" and "...who substituted for the
          ancient Gothic altar, splendidly encumbered with shrines and reliquaries, that heavy marble sarcophagus, with angels' heads and clouds" are a few examples of this. This chapter also discusses how, after repairs to the cathedral after the French
          Revolution, there was not a significant style in what was added. It seems as if the new architecture is now uglier and worse than it was before the repair. ==Literary significance and reception== Hugo introduced with this work the concept of the
          novel as Epic Theatre. A giant epic about the history of a whole people, incarnated in the figure of the great cathedral as witness and silent protagonist of that history, and the whole idea of time and life as an ongoing, organic panorama centered
          on dozens of characters caught in the middle of that history. It is the first novel to have beggars as protagonists. A significant aspect of ''Notre Dame de Paris'' is that it encompasses the whole of life, from the King of France to Paris sewer
          rats, in a manner later co-opted by [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Gustave Flaubert]] and many others, including [[Charles Dickens]]. The enormous popularity of the book in France spurred the nascent historical preservation movement in that country and
          strongly encouraged [[Gothic revival]] architecture. Ultimately it led to major renovations at Notre-Dame in the 19th century led by [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]]. Much of the cathedral's present appearance is a result of this renovation. ==Allusions and
          references== ===Allusions to actual history, geography and current science=== In ''The Hunchback of Notre-Dame'', Victor Hugo makes frequent reference to the architecture of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. He also mentions the invention of the
          [[printing press]], when the bookmaker near the beginning of the work speaks of "the German pest." In 2010, British archivist Adrian Glew discovered references to a real-life hunchback who was a foreman of a government sculpting studio in Paris in
          the 1820s who worked on post-Revolution restorations to the cathedral.<ref name="nikkhah">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/artsandentertainmentbooksreview/7945634/Real-life-Quasimodo-uncovered-in-Tate-archives.html "Real-life Quasimodo uncovered in Tate archives"], Roya Nikkhah, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 15 August 2010</ref>
          ===Allusions in other works=== The name ''Quasimodo'' has become synonymous with "a courageous heart beneath a grotesque exterior."<ref>{{Cite book | last = Webber | first = Elizabeth | author2 = Mike Feinsilber | title = Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | year = 1999 | page = [https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersd0000webb/page/592 592] | url = https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersd0000webb/page/592 | isbn = 0-87779-628-9 }}</ref> ==Adaptations== To date, all of the film and TV adaptations have strayed somewhat from the original plot, some going as far as to give it a happy ending, including in the [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|classic 1939 film]] (although Quasimodo loses Esmeralda to Gringoire in this version). The [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1956 film)|1956 French film]] is one of the few versions to end almost exactly like the novel, although it changes other sections of the story. Unlike most adaptations, the [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|1996 Disney version]] has an ending that is inspired by [[La Esmeralda (opera)|an opera]] created by Hugo himself. ===Films=== * ''[[Esmeralda (1905 film)|Esmeralda]]'', a 1905 French short silent film * ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1911 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', a 1911 silent film * ''[[The Darling of Paris]]'', a 1917 silent film * ''[[Esmeralda (1922 film)|Esmeralda]]'', a 1922 British silent film * ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', a 1923 silent film starring [[Lon Chaney]] as Quasimodo, directed by [[Wallace Worsley]], and produced by [[Carl Laemmle]] and [[Irving Thalberg]] * ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', a 1939 [[sound film]] starring [[Charles Laughton]] as Quasimodo and [[Maureen O'Hara]] as Esmeralda, directed by [[William Dieterle]], and produced by [[Pandro S.

  {{lang|ru|'''Война и миръ'''}};
  {{IPA-ru|vɐjˈna i ˈmʲir|}}) is a literary work mixed with chapters on history and philosophy by the Russian author [[Leo Tolstoy]], first published serially, then published in its entirety in 1869. It is regarded as one of Tolstoy's finest literary
    achievements and remains an internationally praised classic of [[world literature]].<ref>Moser, Charles. 1992. ''Encyclopedia of Russian Literature''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 298–300.</ref>

  The novel chronicles the [[French invasion of Russia]] and the impact of the [[Napoleonic era]] on [[Tsarist]] society through the stories of five Russian [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families. Portions of an earlier version, titled ''The
  Year 1805'',<ref name="Pevear 2008 VIII–IX">{{cite book |title=War and Peace |last=Pevear |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky |others=Trans.

  Tolstoy said ''War and Peace'' is "not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle." Large sections, especially the later chapters, are philosophical discussions rather than narrative.<ref name="wordsworth_intro">{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4HEAN-ti1MC&pg=PR10 |chapter=Introduction? |access-date=2009-03-24 |title=War and Peace |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |year=1993 |isbn=978-1-85326-062-9 }}</ref>
  According to historical information, the writer rewrote the novel several times.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sokolskaya|first=Eugenia|title=War and Peace: 7 Fun Facts|url=https://russianlife.com/stories/online/war-and-peace-7-fun-facts/|access-date=2021-08-06|website=Russian Life|language=en}}</ref>
  Tolstoy also said that the best [[Russian literature]] does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call ''War and Peace'' a novel. Instead, he regarded ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' as his first true novel. ==Composition history== [[File:L.N.Tolstoy
  Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|thumb|upright|Only known color photograph of the author, [[Leo Tolstoy]], taken at his [[Yasnaya Polyana]] estate in 1908 (age 79) by [[Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky]].]] [[File:Tolstoy - War and Peace - ninth
  draft.jpg|thumb|upright|Tolstoy's notes from the ninth draft of ''War and Peace'', 1864.]] Tolstoy began writing ''War and Peace'' in 1863, the year that he finally married and settled down at his country estate. In September of that year, he wrote
  to Elizabeth Bers, his sister-in-law, asking if she could find any chronicles, diaries or records that related to the Napoleonic period in Russia. He was dismayed to find that few written records covered the domestic aspects of Russian life at that
  time, and tried to rectify these omissions in his early drafts of the novel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hare|first=Richard|date=1956|title=Tolstoy's Motives for Writing "War and Peace"|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/126046|journal=The Russian Review|volume=15|issue=2|pages=110–121|doi=10.2307/126046|jstor=126046|issn=0036-0341}}</ref> The first half of the book was written and named "1805". During the writing of the second half, he read widely and acknowledged [[Schopenhauer]] as one of his main inspirations. Tolstoy wrote in a letter to [[Afanasy Fet]] that what he has written in ''War and Peace'' is also said by Schopenhauer in ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''. However, Tolstoy approaches "it from the other side."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Caleb|date=2009|title=Quietism from the Side of Happiness: Tolstoy, Schopenhauer, War and Peace|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/common-knowledge/article-abstract/15/3/395/6636/Quietism-from-the-Side-of-HappinessTolstoy|journal=Common Knowledge|volume=15|issue=3|pages=395–411|doi=10.1215/0961754X-2009-020}}</ref> The first draft of the novel was completed in 1863. In 1865, the periodical {{lang|ru-Latn|Russkiy Vestnik}} (''The Russian Messenger'') published the first part of this draft under the title ''1805'' and published more the following year. Tolstoy was dissatisfied with this version, although he allowed several parts of it to be published with a different ending in 1867. He heavily rewrote the entire novel between 1866 and 1869.<ref name=Knowles/><ref name="FeuerMiller2008"/> Tolstoy's wife, [[Sophia Tolstaya]], copied as many as seven separate complete manuscripts before Tolstoy considered it ready for publication.<ref name="FeuerMiller2008"/> The version that was published in {{lang|ru-Latn|Russkiy Vestnik}}
    had a very different ending from the version eventually published under the title ''War and Peace'' in 1869. Russians who had read the serialized version were eager to buy the complete novel, and it sold out almost immediately. The novel was
    immediately translated after publication into many other languages.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
    It is unknown why Tolstoy changed the name to ''War and Peace''. He may have borrowed the title from the 1861 work of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]:
    {{lang|fr|La Guerre et la Paix}}
    ("War and Peace" in [[French language|French]]).<ref name="Pevear 2008 VIII–IX"/>
    The title may also be another reference to [[Titus]], described as being a master of "war and peace" in ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', written by [[Suetonius]] in 119. The completed novel was then called
    {{lang|ru-Latn|Voyna i mir}}
    ({{lang|ru|Война и мир}}
    in new-style orthography; in English ''War and Peace'').{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
    The ''1805'' manuscript was re-edited and annotated in Russia in 1893 and has been since translated into [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]],
    [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Czech language|Czech]]. Tolstoy was instrumental in bringing a new kind of consciousness to the novel. His narrative
    structure is noted not only for its god's eye point of view over and within events, but also in the way it swiftly and seamlessly portrayed an individual character's view point. His use of visual detail is often comparable to cinema, using literary
    techniques that resemble panning, wide shots and close-ups. These devices, while not exclusive to Tolstoy, are part of the new style of the novel that arose in the mid-19th century and of which Tolstoy proved himself a master.<ref name="j1">{{cite journal |last=Emerson |first=Caryl |year=1985 |title=The Tolstoy Connection in Bakhtin |jstor=462201 |journal=PMLA |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=68–80 (68–71) |doi=10.2307/462201 }}</ref>
    The standard Russian text of ''War and Peace'' is divided into four books (comprising fifteen parts) and an [[epilogue]] in two parts. Roughly the first half is concerned strictly with the fictional characters, whereas the latter parts, as well as
    the second part of the epilogue, increasingly consist of [[essay]]s about the nature of war, power, [[history]], and [[historiography]]. Tolstoy interspersed these essays into the story in a way that defies previous fictional convention. Certain
    abridged versions remove these essays entirely, while others, published even during Tolstoy's life, simply moved these essays into an [[addendum|appendix]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hudspith|first=Sarah|date=|title=Ten Things You Need to Know About War And Peace|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5lrPL2vWJG6Th9zmh1xwqfV/ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-war-and-peace|access-date=30 January 2021|website=BBC Radio 4}}</ref>
    ==Realism== The novel is set 60 years before Tolstoy's day, but he had spoken with people who lived through the 1812 [[French invasion of Russia]]. He read all the standard histories available in Russian and French about the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and
    had read letters, journals, autobiographies and biographies of Napoleon and other key players of that era. There are approximately 160 real persons named or referred to in ''War and Peace''.<ref>Pearson and Volokhonsky, ''op. cit.''</ref>
    He worked from primary source materials (interviews and other documents), as well as from history books, philosophy texts and other historical novels.<ref name="FeuerMiller2008">{{cite book |author1=Kathryn B. Feuer |author2=Robin Feuer Miller |author3=Donna Tussing Orwin |title=Tolstoy and the Genesis of War and Peace |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf7umXHGDPcC |access-date=29 January 2012 |year=2008 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-7447-7 }}</ref>
    Tolstoy also used a great deal of his own experience in the [[Crimean War]] to bring vivid detail and first-hand accounts of how the [[Imperial Russian Army]] was structured.<ref>Troyat, Henri. ''Tolstoy, a biography.'' Doubleday, 1967.</ref>
    Tolstoy was critical of standard history, especially [[military history]], in ''War and Peace''. He explains at the start of the novel's third volume his own views on how history ought to be written. His aim was to blur the line between fiction and
    history, to get closer to the truth, as he states in Volume II.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
    ==Language== [[File:Guerraepace.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''War and Peace'', Italian translation, 1899.]] Although the book is mainly in Russian, significant portions of dialogue are in French. It has been suggested<ref name="figs"/>
    that the use of French is a deliberate literary device, to portray artifice while Russian emerges as a language of sincerity, honesty, and seriousness. It could, however, also simply represent another element of the realistic style in which the book
    is written, since French was the common language of the Russian aristocracy, and more generally the aristocracies of continental Europe, at the time.<ref>{{cite book |title=The ideology of English: French perceptions of English as a world language |last=Flaitz |first=Jeffra |year=1988 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn= 978-3-110-11549-9 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5fotqsglPEC&q=French+language+in+Russian+aristocracy |access-date=2010-11-22}}</ref>
    In fact, the Russian nobility often knew only enough Russian to command their servants; Tolstoy illustrates this by showing that Julie Karagina, a character in the novel, is so unfamiliar with her country's native language that she has to take
    Russian lessons. The use of French diminishes as the book progresses. It is suggested that this is to demonstrate Russia freeing itself from foreign cultural domination,<ref name="figs"/>
    and to show that a once-friendly nation has turned into an enemy. By midway through the book, several of the Russian aristocracy are eager to find Russian tutors for themselves. ==Background and historical context== [[Image:French retreat in 1812 by
    Pryanishnikov.jpg|thumb|''In 1812'' by the Russian artist [[Illarion Pryanishnikov]]]] The novel spans the period from 1805 to 1820. The era of [[Catherine the Great]] was still fresh in the minds of older people. Catherine had made French the
    language of her royal court.<ref name="cath">{{cite book |title=Catherine the Great and the French philosophers of the Enlightenment: Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot and Grim |last=Inna |first=Gorbatov |year=2006 |publisher=[[Academica Press]] |isbn=978-1-933-14603-4 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sHebfZIXFAC&q=catherine+the+great+introduce+French+language+to+Russian+court |access-date=3 December 2010 }}</ref>
    For the next 100 years, it became a [[Diglossia|social requirement]] for the Russian nobility to speak French and understand French culture.<ref name="cath"/>
    The historical context of the novel begins with the execution of [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien]] in 1805, while Russia is ruled by [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Key historical events woven into the novel
    include the [[Ulm Campaign]], the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], the [[Treaties of Tilsit]], and the [[Congress of Erfurt]]. Tolstoy also references the [[Great Comet of 1811]] just before the [[French invasion of Russia]].<ref name="Leo"/>{{rp|1,6,79,83,167,235,240,246,363–364}}
    Tolstoy then uses the [[Battle of Ostrovno]] and the [[Battle of Borodino#Battle of Shevardino Redoubt|Battle of Shevardino Redoubt]] in his novel, before the occupation of Moscow and the subsequent [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|fire]]. The novel continues
    with the [[Battle of Tarutino]], the [[Battle of Maloyaroslavets]], the [[Battle of Vyazma]], and the [[Battle of Krasnoi]]. The final battle cited is the [[Battle of Berezina]], after which the characters move on with rebuilding Moscow and their
    lives.<ref name="Leo"/>{{rp|392–396,449–481,523,586–591,601,613,635,638,655,640}}

    postcard by [[Elisabeth Bohm]]]] The novel tells the story of five families—the Bezukhovs, the Bolkonskys, the Rostovs, the Kuragins, and the Drubetskoys. The main characters are: *The Bezukhovs ** Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov: the father of
    Pierre ** [[Pierre Bezukhov|Count Pyotr Kirillovich ("Pierre") Bezukhov]]: The central character and often a voice for Tolstoy's own beliefs or struggles. Pierre is the socially awkward illegitimate son of Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov, who has
    fathered dozens of illegitimate sons. Educated abroad, Pierre returns to Russia as a misfit. His unexpected inheritance of a large fortune makes him socially desirable. *The Bolkonskys **Prince Nikolai Andreich Bolkonsky: The father of Andrei and
    Maria, the eccentric prince possesses a gruff exterior and displays great insensitivity to the emotional needs of his children. Nevertheless, his harshness often belies hidden depth of feeling. ** [[Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Prince Andrei
    Nikolayevich Bolkonsky]]: A strong but skeptical, thoughtful and philosophical
    {{lang|fr|[[aide-de-camp]]}}
    in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. ** Princess [[Maria Bolkonskaya|Maria Nikolayevna Bolkonskaya]]: Sister of Prince Andrei, Princess Maria is a pious woman whose father attempted to give her a good education. The caring, nurturing nature of her large eyes
    in her otherwise plain face is frequently mentioned. Tolstoy often notes that Princess Maria cannot claim a radiant beauty (like many other female characters of the novel) but she is a person of very high moral values and of high intelligence. *The
    Rostovs ** Count Ilya Andreyevich Rostov: The [[pater-familias]] of the Rostov family; hopeless with finances, generous to a fault. As a result, the Rostovs never have enough cash, despite having many estates. ** Countess Natalya Rostova: The wife of
    Count Ilya Rostov, she is frustrated by her husband's mishandling of their finances, but is determined that her children succeed anyway ** [[Natasha Rostova|Countess Natalya Ilyinichna "Natasha" Rostova]]: A central character, introduced as "not
    pretty but full of life", romantic, impulsive and highly strung. She is an accomplished singer and dancer. ** [[Nikolai Rostov|Count Nikolai Ilyich "Nikolenka" Rostov]]: A [[hussar]], the beloved eldest son of the Rostov family. ** [[Sonya (War and
    Peace)|Sofia Alexandrovna "Sonya" Rostova]]: Orphaned cousin of Vera, Nikolai, Natasha, and Petya Rostov and is in love with Nikolai. ** Countess Vera Ilyinichna Rostova: Eldest of the Rostov children, she marries the German career soldier, Berg. **
    [[Petya Rostov|Pyotr Ilyich "Petya" Rostov]]: Youngest of the Rostov children. *The Kuragins ** Prince Vasily Sergeyevich Kuragin: A ruthless man who is determined to marry his children into wealth at any cost. ** [[Hélène Kuragina|Princess Elena
    Vasilyevna "Hélène" Kuragina]]: A beautiful and sexually alluring woman who has many affairs, including (it is rumoured) with her brother Anatole. ** [[Anatole Kuragin|Prince Anatole Vasilyevich Kuragin]]: Hélène's brother, a handsome and amoral
    pleasure seeker who is secretly married yet tries to elope with Natasha Rostova. ** Prince Ippolit Vasilyevich (Hippolyte) Kuragin: The younger brother of Anatole and perhaps most dim-witted of the three Kuragin children. *The Drubetskoys ** Prince
    Boris Drubetskoy: A poor but aristocratic young man driven by ambition, even at the expense of his friends and benefactors, who marries Julie Karagina for money and is rumored to have had an affair with Hélène Bezukhova. ** Princess Anna Mihalovna
    Drubetskaya: The impoverished mother of Boris, whom she wishes to push up the career ladder. *Other prominent characters ** Fyodor Ivanovich Dolokhov: A cold, almost psychopathic officer, he ruins Nikolai Rostov by luring him into an outrageous
    gambling debt after unsuccessfully proposing to Sonya Rostova. He is also rumored to have had an affair with Hélène Bezukhova and he provides for his poor mother and hunchbacked sister. ** Adolf Karlovich Berg: A young Russian officer, who desires to
    be just like everyone else and marries the young Vera Rostova. ** Anna Pavlovna Scherer: Also known as Annette, she is the hostess of the [[salon (gathering)|salon]] that is the site of much of the novel's action in Petersburg and schemes with Prince
    Vasily Kuragin. ** Maria Dmitryevna Akhrosimova: An older Moscow society lady, good-humored but brutally honest. ** Amalia Evgenyevna Bourienne: A Frenchwoman who lives with the Bolkonskys, primarily as Princess Maria's companion and later at Maria's
    expense. ** Vasily Dmitrich Denisov: Nikolai Rostov's friend and brother officer, who unsuccessfully proposes to Natasha. ** Platon Karataev: The archetypal good Russian peasant, whom Pierre meets in the prisoner-of-war camp. ** Osip Bazdeyev: a
    [[Freemasonry in Russia|Freemason]] who convinces Pierre to join his mysterious group. ** Bilibin: A [[diplomat]] with a reputation for cleverness, an acquaintance of Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. In addition, several real-life historical characters (such
    as [[Napoleon]] and Prince [[Mikhail Kutuzov]]) play a prominent part in the book. Many of Tolstoy's characters were based on real people. His grandparents and their friends were the models for many of the main characters; his great-grandparents
    would have been of the generation of Prince Vassily or Count Ilya Rostov. ==Plot summary== ===Book One=== [[File:Maria Fedorovna by Vigee-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|The Empress Dowager, [[Maria Fyodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Maria Feodorovna]],
    mother of reigning Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], is the most powerful woman in the Russian royal court.]] The novel begins in July 1805 in [[Saint Petersburg]], at a [[soirée]] given by Anna Pavlovna Scherer, the [[maid of honour]] and
    confidante to the [[dowager Empress]] [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Maria Feodorovna]]. Many of the main characters are introduced as they enter the salon. [[Pierre Bezukhov|Pierre (Pyotr Kirilovich) Bezukhov]] is the
    illegitimate son of a wealthy [[count]], who is dying after a series of strokes. Pierre is about to become embroiled in a struggle for his inheritance. Educated abroad at his father's expense following his mother's death, Pierre is kindhearted but
    socially awkward, and finds it difficult to integrate into Petersburg society. It is known to everyone at the soirée that Pierre is his father's favorite of all the old count's illegitimate progeny. They respect Pierre during the soiree because his
    father, Count Bezukhov, is a very rich man, and as Pierre is his favorite, most aristocrats think that the fortune of his father will be given to him even though he is illegitimate. Also attending the soirée is Pierre's friend, Prince Andrei
    Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, husband of Lise, a charming society favourite. He is disillusioned with Petersburg society and with married life; feeling that his wife is empty and superficial, he comes to hate her and all women, expressing patently
    misogynistic views to Pierre when the two are alone. Pierre does not quite know what to do with this, and is made uncomfortable witnessing the marital discord. Pierre had been sent to St Petersburg by his father to choose a career for himself, but he
    is quite uncomfortable because he cannot find one and everybody keeps on asking about this. Andrei tells Pierre he has decided to become
    {{lang|fr|[[aide-de-camp]]}}
    to Prince [[Mikhail Ilarionovich Kutuzov]] in the [[war of the Third Coalition|coming war]] (The Battle of Austerlitz) against [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] in order to escape a life he cannot stand. The plot moves to [[Moscow]], Russia's former capital,
    contrasting its provincial, more Russian ways to the more European society of Saint Petersburg. The Rostov family is introduced. Count Ilya Andreyevich Rostov and Countess Natalya Rostova are an affectionate couple but forever worried about their
    disordered finances. They have four children. Thirteen-year-old Natasha (Natalia Ilyinichna) believes herself in love with Boris Drubetskoy, a young man who is about to join the army as an officer, the mother of Boris is Anna Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya
    who is a childhood friend of the countess Natalya Rostova, Boris is also the godson of Count Bezukhov (Pierre's father). Twenty-year-old Nikolai Ilyich pledges his love to Sonya (Sofia Alexandrovna), his fifteen-year-old cousin, an orphan who has
    been brought up by the Rostovs. The eldest child, Vera Ilyinichna, is cold and somewhat haughty but has a good prospective marriage to a Russian-German officer, Adolf Karlovich Berg. Petya (Pyotr Ilyich) at nine is the youngest; like his brother, he
    is impetuous and eager to join the army when of age. At Bald Hills, the Bolkonskys' country estate, Prince Andrei departs for war and leaves his terrified, pregnant wife Lise with his eccentric father Prince Nikolai Andreyevich and devoutly religious
    sister Maria Nikolayevna Bolkonskaya, who refuses to marry the son of a wealthy aristocrat on account of her devotion to her father and suspicion that the young man would be unfaithful to her. The second part opens with descriptions of the impending
    Russian-French war preparations. At the [[Battle of Schöngrabern|Schöngrabern engagement]], Nikolai Rostov, now an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[Russian hussars|hussars]], has his first taste of battle. Boris Drubetskoy introduces him to Prince
    Andrei, whom Rostov insults in a fit of impetuousness. He is deeply attracted by [[Tsar Alexander I|Tsar Alexander]]'s charisma. Nikolai gambles and socializes with his officer, Vasily Dmitrich Denisov, and befriends the ruthless Fyodor Ivanovich
    Dolokhov. Bolkonsky, Rostov and Denisov are involved in the disastrous [[Battle of Austerlitz]], in which Prince Andrei is badly wounded as he attempts to rescue a Russian standard. The Battle of Austerlitz is a major event in the book. As the battle
    is about to start, Prince Andrei thinks the approaching "day [will] be his [[Siege of Toulon|Toulon]], or his [[Battle of Arcole|Arcola]]",<ref name="day">Leo Tolstoy, ''War and Peace.'' p. 317</ref>
    references to Napoleon's early victories. Later in the battle, however, Andrei falls into enemy hands and even meets his hero, Napoleon. But his previous enthusiasm has been shattered; he no longer thinks much of Napoleon, "so petty did his hero with
    his paltry vanity and delight in victory appear, compared to that lofty, righteous and kindly sky which he had seen and comprehended".<ref name="sky">Tolstoy p. 340</ref>
    Tolstoy portrays Austerlitz as an early test for Russia, one which ended badly because the soldiers fought for irrelevant things like glory or renown rather than the higher virtues which would produce, according to Tolstoy, a victory at [[Battle of
    Borodino|Borodino]] during the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|1812 invasion]]. ===Book Two=== Book Two begins with Nikolai Rostov briefly returning on leave to Moscow accompanied by his friend Denisov, his officer from his [[Pavlograd Hussar
    Regiment|Pavlograd Regiment]]. He spends an eventful winter at home. Natasha has blossomed into a beautiful young girl. Denisov falls in love with her and proposes marriage, but is rejected. Nikolai meets Dolokhov, and they grow closer as friends.
    Dolokhov falls in love with Sonya, Nikolai's cousin, but as she is in love with Nikolai, she rejects Dolokhov's proposal. Nikolai meets Dolokhov some time later. The resentful Dolokhov challenges Nikolai at cards, and Nikolai loses every hand until
    he sinks into a 43,000 ruble debt. Although his mother pleads with Nikolai to marry a wealthy heiress to rescue the family from its dire financial straits, he refuses. Instead, he promises to marry his childhood crush and orphaned cousin, the
    dowry-less Sonya. Pierre Bezukhov, upon finally receiving his massive inheritance, is suddenly transformed from a bumbling young man into the most eligible bachelor in Russian society. Despite knowing that it is wrong, he is convinced into marriage
    with Prince Kuragin's beautiful and immoral daughter Hélène (Elena Vasilyevna Kuragina). Hélène, who is rumored to be involved in an incestuous affair with her brother Anatole, tells Pierre that she will never have children with him. Hélène is also
    rumored to be having an affair with Dolokhov, who mocks Pierre in public. Pierre loses his temper and challenges Dolokhov to a [[duel]]. Unexpectedly (because Dolokhov is a seasoned dueller), Pierre wounds Dolokhov. Hélène denies her affair, but
    Pierre is convinced of her guilt and leaves her. In his moral and spiritual confusion, Pierre joins the [[History of Freemasonry in Russia|Freemasons]]. Much of Book Two concerns his struggles with his passions and his spiritual conflicts. He
    abandons his former carefree behavior and enters upon a philosophical quest particular to Tolstoy: how should one live a moral life in an ethically imperfect world? The question continually baffles Pierre. He attempts to liberate his [[serfs]], but
    ultimately achieves nothing of note. Pierre is contrasted with Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. Andrei recovers from his near-fatal wound in a military hospital and returns home, only to find his wife Lise dying in childbirth. He is stricken by his guilty
    conscience for not treating her better. His child, Nikolai, survives. Burdened with [[nihilism|nihilistic]] disillusionment, Prince Andrei does not return to the army but remains on his estate, working on a project that would codify military behavior
    to solve problems of disorganization responsible for the loss of life on the Russian side. Pierre visits him and brings new questions: where is God in this [[amorality|amoral]] world? Pierre is interested in [[panentheism]] and the possibility of an
    [[afterlife]].[[File: Red Square in Moscow (1801) by Fedor Alekseev.jpg|thumb|Scene in [[Red Square]], Moscow, 1801. Oil on canvas by [[Fyodor Alekseyev|Fedor Yakovlevich Alekseev]].]] Pierre's wife, Hélène, begs him to take her back, and trying to
    abide by the Freemason laws of forgiveness, he agrees. Hélène establishes herself as an influential hostess in Petersburg society. Prince Andrei feels impelled to take his newly written military notions to Saint Petersburg, naively expecting to
    influence either the Emperor himself or those close to him. Young Natasha, also in Saint Petersburg, is caught up in the excitement of her first grand ball, where she meets Prince Andrei and briefly reinvigorates him with her vivacious charm. Andrei
    believes he has found purpose in life again and, after paying the Rostovs several visits, proposes marriage to Natasha. However, Andrei's father dislikes the Rostovs and opposes the marriage, insisting that the couple wait a year before marrying.
    Prince Andrei leaves to recuperate from his wounds abroad, leaving Natasha distraught. Count Rostov takes her and Sonya to Moscow in order to raise funds for her trousseau. Natasha visits the Moscow [[opera]], where she meets Hélène and her brother
    Anatole. Anatole has since married a [[Poles|Polish]] woman whom he abandoned in Poland. He is very attracted to Natasha and determined to seduce her, and conspires with his sister to do so. Anatole succeeds in making Natasha believe he loves her,
    eventually establishing plans to elope. Natasha writes to Princess Maria, Andrei's sister, breaking off her engagement. At the last moment, Sonya discovers her plans to elope and foils them. Natasha learns from Pierre of Anatole's marriage.
    Devastated, Natasha makes a suicide attempt and is left seriously ill. Pierre is initially horrified by Natasha's behavior but realizes he has fallen in love with her. As the [[C/1811 F1|Great Comet of 1811–12]] streaks the sky, life appears to begin
    anew for Pierre. Prince Andrei coldly accepts Natasha's breaking of the engagement. He tells Pierre that his pride will not allow him to renew his proposal. ===Book Three=== [[File:Battle of Borodino 1812.png|thumb|The [[Battle of Borodino]], fought
    on September 7, 1812, and involving more than a quarter of a million troops and seventy thousand casualties was a turning point in Napoleon's failed campaign to defeat Russia. It is vividly depicted through the plot and characters of ''War and
    Peace''.<br/>Painting
      by [[Louis-François, Baron Lejeune]], 1822.]] With the help of her family, and the stirrings of religious faith, Natasha manages to persevere in Moscow through this dark period. Meanwhile, the whole of Russia is affected by the coming confrontation
      between Napoleon's army and the Russian army. Pierre convinces himself through [[gematria]] that Napoleon is the [[Antichrist]] of the ''[[Book of Revelation]]''. Old Prince Bolkonsky dies of a stroke knowing that French marauders are coming for his
      estate. No organized help from any Russian army seems available to the Bolkonskys, but Nikolai Rostov turns up at their estate in time to help put down an incipient peasant revolt. He finds himself attracted to the distraught Princess Maria. Back in
      Moscow, the patriotic Petya joins a crowd in audience of [[Alexander I of Russia|Tzar Alexander]] and manages to snatch a biscuit thrown from the balcony window of the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Cathedral of the Assumption]] by the Tzar. He is
      nearly crushed by the throngs in his effort. Under the influence of the same patriotism, his father finally allows him to enlist. Napoleon himself is the main character in this section, and the novel presents him in vivid detail, both personally and
      as both a thinker and would-be strategist. Also described are the well-organized force of over four hundred thousand troops of the French [[Grande Armée]] (only one hundred and forty thousand of them actually French-speaking) that marches through the
      Russian countryside in the late summer and reaches the outskirts of the city of [[Smolensk]]. Pierre decides to leave Moscow and go to watch the [[Battle of Borodino]] from a vantage point next to a Russian artillery crew. After watching for a time,
      he begins to join in carrying ammunition. In the midst of the turmoil he experiences first-hand the death and destruction of war; Eugène's artillery continues to pound Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout set up a crossfire with
      artillery positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. The battle becomes a hideous slaughter for both armies and ends in a standoff. The Russians, however, have won a moral victory by standing up to Napoleon's reputedly invincible army. The Russian army
      withdraws the next day, allowing Napoleon to march on to Moscow. Among the casualties are Anatole Kuragin and Prince Andrei. Anatole loses a leg, and Andrei suffers a grenade wound in the abdomen. Both are reported dead, but their families are in
      such disarray that no one can be notified. ===Book Four=== The Rostovs have waited until the last minute to abandon Moscow, even after it became clear that Kutuzov had retreated past Moscow. The Muscovites are being given contradictory instructions
      on how to either flee or fight. [[Fyodor Rostopchin|Count Fyodor Rostopchin]], the commander in chief of Moscow, is publishing posters, rousing the citizens to put their faith in religious [[icon]]s, while at the same time urging them to fight with
      pitchforks if necessary. Before fleeing himself, he gives orders to [[Scorched earth|burn the city]]. However, Tolstoy states that the burning of an abandoned city mostly built of wood was inevitable, and while the French blame the Russians, these
      blame the French. The Rostovs have a difficult time deciding what to take with them, but in the end, Natasha convinces them to load their carts with the wounded and dying from the Battle of Borodino. Unknown to Natasha, Prince Andrei is amongst the
      wounded. When Napoleon's army finally occupies an abandoned and [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|burning Moscow]], Pierre takes off on a [[Don Quixote|quixotic]] mission to assassinate [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. He becomes anonymous in all the chaos,
      shedding his responsibilities by wearing peasant clothes and shunning his duties and lifestyle. The only people he sees are Natasha and some of her family, as they depart Moscow. Natasha recognizes and smiles at him, and he in turn realizes the full
      scope of his love for her. Pierre saves the life of a French officer who enters his home looking for shelter, and they have a long, amicable conversation. The next day Pierre goes into the street to resume his assassination plan, and comes across two
      French soldiers robbing an Armenian family. When one of the soldiers tries to rip the necklace off the young Armenian woman's neck, Pierre intervenes by attacking the soldiers, and is taken prisoner by the French army. He believes he will be
      executed, but in the end is spared. He witnesses, with horror, the execution of other prisoners. [[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s retreat from Moscow. Painting by [[Adolf Northern]] (1828–1876)]] Pierre
      becomes friends with a fellow prisoner, Platon Karataev, a Russian peasant with a saintly demeanor. In Karataev, Pierre finally finds what he has been seeking: an honest person of integrity, who is utterly without pretense. Pierre discovers meaning
      in life simply by interacting with him. After witnessing French soldiers sacking Moscow and shooting Russian civilians arbitrarily, Pierre is forced to march with the Grand Army during its disastrous retreat from Moscow in the harsh [[Russian
      Winter|Russian winter]]. After months of tribulation—during which the fever-plagued Karataev is shot by the French—Pierre is finally freed by a Russian raiding party led by Dolokhov and Denisov, after a small skirmish with the French that sees the
      young Petya Rostov killed in action. Meanwhile, Andrei has been taken in and cared for by the Rostovs, fleeing from Moscow to [[Yaroslavl]]. He is reunited with Natasha and his sister Maria before the end of the war. In an internal transformation, he
      loses the fear of death and forgives Natasha in a last act before dying. Nikolai becomes worried about his family's finances, and leaves the army after hearing of Petya's death. There is little hope for recovery. Given the Rostov's ruin, he does not
      feel comfortable with the prospect of marrying the wealthy Marya Bolkonsky, but when they meet again they both still feel love for each other. As the novel draws to a close, Pierre's wife Hélène dies from an overdose of an [[abortifacient]] (Tolstoy
      does not state it explicitly but the euphemism he uses is unambiguous). Pierre is reunited with Natasha, while the victorious Russians rebuild Moscow. Natasha speaks of Prince Andrei's death and Pierre of Karataev's. Both are aware of a growing bond
      between them in their bereavement. With the help of Princess Maria, Pierre finds love at last and marries Natasha. ===Epilogue in two parts=== ====First part==== The first part of the epilogue begins with the wedding of Pierre and Natasha in 1813.
      Count Rostov dies soon after, leaving his eldest son Nikolai to take charge of the debt-ridden estate. Nikolai finds himself with the task of maintaining the family on the verge of bankruptcy. His just treatment of peasants earns him respect and
      love, and his situation improves. He and Maria now have children. Nikolai and Maria then move to Bald Hills with his mother and Sonya, whom he supports for the rest of their lives. They also raise Prince Andrei's orphaned son, Nikolai Andreyevich
      (Nikolenka) Bolkonsky. As in all good marriages, there are misunderstandings, but the couples – Pierre and Natasha, Nikolai and Maria – remain devoted to their spouses. Pierre and Natasha visit Bald Hills in 1820. There is a hint in the closing
      chapters that the idealistic, boyish Nikolenka and Pierre would both become part of the [[Decembrist Uprising]]. The first epilogue concludes with Nikolenka promising he would do something with which even his late father "would be satisfied"
      (presumably as a [[revolutionary]] in the Decembrist revolt). ====Second part==== The second part of the epilogue contains Tolstoy's critique of all existing forms of mainstream history. The 19th-century [[Great Man Theory]] claims that historical
      events are the result of the actions of "heroes" and other great individuals; Tolstoy argues that this is impossible because of how rarely these actions result in great historical events. Rather, he argues, great historical events are the result of
      many smaller events driven by the thousands of individuals involved (he compares this to calculus, and the sum of infinitesimals). He then goes on to argue that these smaller events are the result of an inverse relationship between necessity and
      free-will, necessity being based on reason and therefore explicable through historical analysis, and free-will being based on "consciousness" and therefore inherently unpredictable. ==Reception== [[File:Ростова пастернак.jpeg|thumb|[[Leonid
      Pasternak]]'s 1893 illustration to ''War and Peace'']] The novel that made its author "the true lion of the [[Russian literature]]" (according to [[Ivan Goncharov]])<ref name="sukhikh">{{cite web |author=Sukhikh, Igor |year=2007 |url=http://magazines.russ.ru/zvezda/2007/2/su15.html |title=The History of XIX Russian literature |work=[[Zvezda (magazine)|Zvezda]] |access-date=2012-03-01 }}</ref><ref name="op"/>
    enjoyed great success with the reading public upon its publication and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays, some of which (by [[Dmitry Pisarev]], [[Pavel Annenkov]], Dragomirov and Strakhov) formed the basis for the research of later
    Tolstoy scholars.<ref name="op">Opulskaya, L.D. ''War and Peace: the Epic''. L.N. Tolstoy. Works in 12 volumes. War and Peace. Commentaries. Vol. 7. Moscow, Khudozhesstvennaya Literatura. 1974. pp. 363–89</ref>
    Yet the Russian press's initial response to the novel was muted, with most critics unable to decide how to classify it. The liberal newspaper ''[[Golos (newspaper)|Golos]]'' (The Voice, April 3, #93, 1865) was one of the first to react. Its anonymous
    reviewer posed a question later repeated by many others: "What could this possibly be? What kind of genre are we supposed to file it to?.. Where is fiction in it, and where is real history?"<ref name="op"/>
    Writer and critic Nikolai Akhsharumov, writing in
    {{lang|ru-Latn|Vsemirny Trud}}
    (#6, 1867) suggested that ''War and Peace'' was "neither a chronicle, nor a historical novel", but a genre merger, this ambiguity never undermining its immense value. Annenkov, who praised the novel too, was equally vague when trying to classify it.
    "The cultural history of one large section of our society, the political and social panorama of it in the beginning of the current century", was his suggestion. "It is the [social] epic, the history novel and the vast picture of the whole nation's
    life", wrote [[Ivan Turgenev]] in his bid to define ''War and Peace'' in the foreword for his French translation of "The Two Hussars" (published in Paris by
    {{lang|fr|[[Le Temps]]}}
    in 1875). In general, the literary left received the novel coldly. They saw it as devoid of social critique, and keen on the idea of national unity. They saw its major fault as the "author's inability to portray a new kind of revolutionary
    intelligentsia in his novel", as critic [[Varfolomey Zaytsev]] put it.<ref>Zaitsev, V., Pearls and Adamants of Russian Journalism. Russkoye Slovo, 1865, #2.</ref>
    Articles by [[Dmitry Minayev|D. Minayev]],

    and [[Nikolai Shelgunov|N. Shelgunov]] in
    {{lang|ru-Latn|[[Delo (magazine)|Delo]]}}
    magazine characterized the novel as "lacking realism", showing its characters as "cruel and rough", "mentally stoned", "morally depraved" and promoting "the philosophy of stagnation". Still, [[Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin]], who never expressed his
    opinion of the novel publicly, in private conversation was reported to have expressed delight with "how strongly this Count has stung our higher society".<ref>Kuzminskaya, T.A., My Life at home and at Yasnaya Polyana. Tula, 1958, 343</ref>
    [[Dmitry Pisarev]] in his unfinished article "Russian Gentry of Old" ({{lang|ru-Latn|Staroye barstvo}},
    {{lang|ru-Latn|[[Otechestvennye Zapiski]]}}, #2, 1868), while praising Tolstoy's realism in portraying members of high society, was still unhappy with the way the author, as he saw it, 'idealized' the old nobility, expressing "unconscious and quite
      natural tenderness towards" the Russian [[dvoryanstvo]]. On the opposite front, the conservative press and "patriotic" authors (A. S. Norov and P. A. Vyazemsky among them) were accusing Tolstoy of consciously distorting 1812 history, desecrating the
      "patriotic feelings of our fathers" and ridiculing dvoryanstvo.<ref name="op"/>
    One of the first comprehensive articles on the novel was that of Pavel Annenkov, published in #2, 1868 issue of ''[[Vestnik Evropy]]''. The critic praised Tolstoy's masterful portrayal of man at war, marveled at the complexity of the whole
    composition, organically merging historical facts and fiction. "The dazzling side of the novel", according to Annenkov, was "the natural simplicity with which [the author] transports the worldly affairs and big social events down to the level of a
    character who witnesses them." Annekov thought the historical gallery of the novel was incomplete with the two "great [[Raznochintsy|raznotchintsys]]", [[Mikhail Speransky|Speransky]] and [[Aleksey Arakcheyev|Arakcheev]], and deplored the fact that
    the author stopped at introducing to the novel "this relatively rough but original element". In the end the critic called the novel "the whole epoch in the Russian fiction".<ref name="op"/>
    [[Slavophiles]] declared Tolstoy their "{{lang|ru-Latn|[[bogatyr]]}}" and pronounced ''War and Peace'' "the Bible of the new national idea". Several articles on ''War and Peace'' were published in 1869–70 in ''[[Zarya (magazine)|Zarya]]'' magazine by
      [[Nikolai Strakhov]]. "''War and Peace'' is the work of genius, equal to everything that the Russian literature has produced before", he pronounced in the first, smaller essay. "It is now quite clear that from 1868 when the ''War and Peace'' was
      published the very essence of what we call Russian literature has become quite different, acquired the new form and meaning", the critic continued later. Strakhov was the first critic in Russia who declared Tolstoy's novel to be a masterpiece of
      level previously unknown in Russian literature. Still, being a true Slavophile, he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major Slavophiliac ideas of "meek Russian character's supremacy over the rapacious European kind" (using [[Apollon
      Grigoriev]]'s formula). Years later, in 1878, discussing Strakhov's own book ''The World as a Whole'', Tolstoy criticized both Grigoriev's concept (of "Russian meekness ''vs.'' Western bestiality") and Strakhov's interpretation of it.<ref>Gusev, N.I. Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy. Materials for Biography, 1855–1869. Moscow, 1967. pp. 856–57.</ref>
    [[File:Shengraben1.jpg|thumb|''[[Battle of Schöngrabern]]'' by K.Bujnitsky]] Among the reviewers were military men and authors specializing in war literature. Most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of Tolstoy's battle scenes. N. Lachinov, a
    member of the ''[[Russky Invalid]]'' newspaper staff (#69, April 10, 1868) called the [[Battle of Schöngrabern]] scenes "bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness" and totally agreed with the author's view on the [[Battle of
    Borodino]], which some of his opponents disputed. The army general and respected military writer [[Mikhail Dragomirov]], in an article published in
    {{lang|ru-Latn|Oruzheiny Sbornik}}
    (''The Military Almanac'', 1868–70), while disputing some of Tolstoy's ideas concerning the "spontaneity" of wars and the role of commander in battles, advised all the Russian Army officers to use ''War and Peace'' as their desk book, describing its
    battle scenes as "incomparable" and "serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theories of military art."<ref name="op"/>
    Unlike professional literary critics, most prominent Russian writers of the time supported the novel wholeheartedly. Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Dostoyevsky and Fet have all gone on record as declaring ''War and Peace'' the masterpiece of the
    Russian literature. [[Ivan Goncharov]] in a July 17, 1878 letter to Pyotr Ganzen advised him to choose for translating into [[Danish language|Danish]] ''War and Peace'', adding: "This is positively what might be called a Russian ''[[Iliad]]''.
    Embracing the whole epoch, it is the grandiose literary event, showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively brush of the great master ... This is one of the most, if not the most profound literary work ever".<ref>''The Literature Archive'', vol. 6, Academy of Science of the USSR, 1961, p. 81</ref>
    In 1879, unhappy with Ganzen having chosen ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' to start with, Goncharov insisted: "War and Peace is the extraordinary poem of a novel, both in content and execution. It also serves as a monument to Russian history's glorious epoch
    when whatever figure you take is a colossus, a statue in bronze. Even [the novel's] minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the Russian people and its life."<ref>Literary Archive, p. 94</ref>
    In 1885, expressing satisfaction with the fact that Tolstoy's works had by then been translated into Danish, Goncharov again stressed the immense importance of ''War and Peace''. "Count Tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here [in Russia]", he
    remarked.<ref>Literary Archive, p. 104.</ref>
    [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] (in a May 30, 1871 letter to Strakhov) described ''War and Peace'' as "the last word of the landlord's literature and the brilliant one at that". In a draft version of ''[[The Raw Youth]]'' he described Tolstoy as "a
    historiograph of the
    {{lang|ru-Latn|[[dvoryanstvo]]}}, or rather, its cultural elite". "The objectivity and realism impart wonderful charm to all scenes, and alongside people of talent, honour and duty he exposes numerous scoundrels, worthless goons and fools", he added.<ref>The Beginnings (Nachala), 1922. #2, p. 219</ref>
    In 1876 Dostoyevsky wrote: "My strong conviction is that a writer of fiction has to have most profound knowledge—not only of the poetic side of his art, but also the reality he deals with, in its historical as well as contemporary context. Here [in
    Russia], as far as I see it, only one writer excels in this, Count Lev Tolstoy."<ref>Dostoyevsky, F.M., ''Letters, Vol. III'', 1934, p. 206.</ref>
    [[Nikolai Leskov]], then an anonymous reviewer in
    {{lang|ru-Latn|Birzhevy Vestnik}}
    (''The Stock Exchange Herald''), wrote several articles praising highly ''War and Peace'', calling it "the best ever Russian historical novel" and "the pride of the contemporary literature". Marveling at the realism and factual truthfulness of
    Tolstoy's book, Leskov thought the author deserved the special credit for "having lifted up the people's spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved". "While working most elaborately upon individual characters, the author, apparently, has been studying
    most diligently the character of the nation as a whole; the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the Army that came up to fight mighty Napoleon. In this respect the novel of Count Tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the
    Great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers", Leskov wrote.<ref name="op"/>
    [[Afanasy Fet]], in a January 1, 1870 letter to Tolstoy, expressed his great delight with the novel. "You've managed to show us in great detail the other, mundane side of life and explain how organically does it feed the outer, heroic side of it", he
    added.<ref>Gusev, p. 858</ref>
    [[Ivan Turgenev]] gradually re-considered his initial skepticism as to the novel's historical aspect and also the style of Tolstoy's psychological analysis. In his 1880 article written in the form of a letter addressed to Edmond Abou, the editor of
    the French newspaper
    {{lang|fr|Le XIX<sup>e</sup> Siècle}}, Turgenev described Tolstoy as "the most popular Russian writer" and ''War and Peace'' as "one of the most remarkable books of our age".<ref>Gusev, pp. 863–74</ref>
    "This vast work has the spirit of an epic, where the life of Russia of the beginning of our century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master ... The manner in which Count Tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative
    and original. This is the great work of a great writer, and in it there’s true, real Russia", Turgenev wrote.<ref>''The Complete I.S. Turgenev, vol. XV'', Moscow; Leningrad, 1968, 187–88</ref>
    It was largely due to Turgenev's efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the European readership. The first French edition of the ''War and Peace'' (1879) paved the way for the worldwide success of Leo Tolstoy and his works.<ref name="op"/>
    Since then many world-famous authors have praised ''War and Peace'' as a masterpiece of world literature. [[Gustave Flaubert]] expressed his delight in [[Flaubert's letters|a January 1880 letter]] to Turgenev, writing: "This is the first class work!
    What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite. I used to utter shrieks of delight while reading. This is powerful, very powerful indeed."<ref>Motylyova, T. ''Of the worldwide significance of Tolstoy''. Moscow. Sovetsky pisatel Publishers, 1957, p. 520.</ref>
    Later [[John Galsworthy]] called ''War and Peace'' "the best novel that had ever been written". [[Romain Rolland]], remembering his reading the novel as a student, wrote: "this work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in
    its eternal movement."<ref>{{lang|ru-Latn|Literaturnoye Nasledstsvo}}, vol. 75, book 1, p. 61</ref>
    [[Thomas Mann]] thought ''War and Peace'' to be "the greatest ever war novel in the history of literature."<ref>{{lang|ru-Latn|Literaturnoye Nasledstsvo}}, vol. 75, book 1, p. 173</ref>
    [[Ernest Hemingway]] confessed that it was from Tolstoy that he had been taking lessons on how to "write about war in the most straightforward, honest, objective and stark way." "I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy
    did", Hemingway asserted in his 1955 ''Men at War. The Best War Stories of All Time'' anthology.<ref name="op"/>
    [[Isaak Babel]] said, after reading ''War and Peace'', "If the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy."<ref>"Introduction to War and Peace" by Richard Pevear in Pevear, Richard and Larissa Volokhonsky, ''War and Peace'', 2008, Vintage Classics.</ref>
    Tolstoy "gives us a unique combination of the 'naive objectivity' of the oral narrator with the interest in detail characteristic of realism. This is the reason for our trust in his presentation."<ref name="greenwood">{{cite book |first=Edward Baker |last=Greenwood |chapter=What is ''War and Peace''? |title=Tolstoy: The Comprehensive Vision |location=London |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=1980 |page=83 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=taQOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA83 |isbn=0-416-74130-4 }}</ref>
    ==English translations== ''War and Peace'' has been translated into many languages. It has been translated into English on several occasions, starting with Clara Bell working from a French translation. The translators [[Constance Garnett]] and
    [[Louise and Aylmer Maude]] knew Tolstoy personally. Translations have to deal with Tolstoy's often peculiar syntax and his fondness for repetitions. Only about 2 percent of ''War and Peace'' is in French; Tolstoy removed the French in a revised 1873
    edition, only to restore it later.<ref name="figs">{{cite journal|author=Figes|first=Orlando|date=November 22, 2007|title=Tolstoy's Real Hero|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2007/nov/22/tolstoys-real-hero/?pagination=false|journal=New York Review of Books|volume=54|issue=18|pages=53–56|access-date=30 January 2021|via=}}</ref> Most translators follow Garnett retaining some French; Briggs and Shubin both use no French, while Pevear-Volokhonsky and Amy Mandelker's revision of the Maude translation both retain the French fully.<ref name="figs"/> ===List of English translations=== <!--Please do not include any translations into a non-English language.

    characteristically Russian folk expressions and proverbs. ... She is faithful to the text and does not hesitate to render conscientiously those details that the uninitiated may find bewildering: for instance, the statement that Boris's mother
    pronounced his name with a stress on the ''o'' – an indication to the Russian reader of the old lady's affectation." On the Garnett translation Pavlovskis-Petit writes: "her ...''War and Peace'' is frequently inexact and contains too many anglicisms.
    Her style is awkward and turgid, very unsuitable for Tolstoi." On the Maudes' translation she comments: "this should have been the best translation, but the Maudes' lack of adroitness in dealing with Russian folk idiom, and their style in general,
    place this version below Dunnigan's." She further comments on Edmonds's revised translation, formerly on [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]: "[it] is the work of a sound scholar but not the best possible translator; it frequently lacks resourcefulness and
    imagination in its use of English. ... a respectable translation but not on the level of Dunnigan or Maude."<ref>Pavlovskis-Petit, Zoja. Entry: Lev Tolstoi, ''War and Peace''.

    ==Adaptations== ===Film=== * The [[War and Peace (1915 film)|first Russian adaptation]] was
    {{lang|ru|Война и мир}}
    ({{lang|ru-Latn|Voyna i mir}}) in 1915, which was directed by [[Vladimir Gardin]] and starred Gardin and the Russian ballerina [[Vera Karalli]]. F. Kamei produced a version in Japan in 1947. * The [[War and Peace (1956 film)|208-minute-long American
      1956 version]] was directed by [[King Vidor]] and starred [[Audrey Hepburn]] (Natasha), [[Henry Fonda]] (Pierre) and [[Mel Ferrer]] (Andrei). Audrey Hepburn was nominated for a [[BAFTA]] Award for best British actress and for a [[Golden Globe Award]]
      for best actress in a drama production. * The critically acclaimed, four-part and 431-minutes long Soviet ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'', by director [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], was released in 1966 and 1967. It starred [[Lyudmila
      Savelyeva]] (as Natasha Rostova) and [[Vyacheslav Tikhonov]] (as Andrei Bolkonsky). Bondarchuk himself played the character of Pierre Bezukhov. It involved thousands of extras and took six years to finish the shooting, as a result of which the actors
      age changed dramatically from scene to scene. It won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film]] for its authenticity and massive scale.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}
    Bondarchuk's film is considered to be the best screen version of the novel. It attracted some controversy due to the number of horses killed during the making of the battle sequences and screenings were actively boycotted in several US cities by the
    ASPCA.<ref>{{cite news |last=Curtis |first=Charlotte |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/53286/War-and-Peace/overview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013183136/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/53286/War-and-Peace/overview |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-13 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]] |date=2007 |title=War-and-Peace |access-date=2014-04-20}}</ref>

    | spouse = | partner = | children = | relatives = | influences = | influenced = | awards = [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] 1989 [[Legion d'Honneur]] 1997 | signature = | website = }} '''Augusto Roa Bastos''' (13 June 1917&nbsp;– 26 April 2005) was a
    [[Paraguay]]an novelist and short story writer. As a teenager he fought in the [[Chaco War]] between Paraguay and [[Bolivia]], and he later worked as a journalist, screenwriter and professor. He is best known for his complex novel ''Yo el Supremo''
    (''[[I, the Supreme]]'') and for winning the ''[[Miguel de Cervantes Prize|Premio Miguel de Cervantes]]'' in 1989, Spanish literature's most prestigious prize. ''Yo el Supremo'' explores the dictations and inner thoughts of [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de
    Francia]], the eccentric dictator of Paraguay who ruled with an iron fist, from 1814 until his death in 1840. Roa Bastos' life and writing were marked by experience with dictatorial military regimes. In 1947 he was forced into exile in Argentina, and
    in 1976 he fled [[Buenos Aires]] for France in similar political circumstances. Most of Roa Bastos' work was written in exile, but this did not deter him from fiercely tackling Paraguayan social and historical issues in his work. Writing in a Spanish
    that was at times heavily augmented by [[Guarani language|Guaraní]] words (the major Paraguayan indigenous language), Roa Bastos incorporated Paraguayan myths and symbols into a Baroque style known as [[magical realism]]. He is considered a
    late-comer to the [[Latin American Boom]] literary movement. Roa Bastos' canon includes the novels ''[[Hijo de hombre]]'' (1960; ''Son of Man'') and ''El fiscal'' (1993; ''The Prosecutor''), as well as numerous other novels, short stories, poems, and
    screenplays. == Biography == === Early life (1917–1932) === Roa Bastos was born in [[Asunción]] on 13 June 1917. He spent his childhood in [[Iturbe (Paraguay)|Iturbe]], a provincial town in the Guaira region where his father was an administrator on a
    sugar plantation.{{sfn|King|1983|p=16}}
    It was here, some
    {{convert|200|km|mi}}
    to the south of the Paraguayan capital of Asunción, that Roa Bastos learned to speak both Spanish and [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]], the language of Paraguay's indigenous people. At the age of ten he was sent to school in Asunción where he stayed with
    his uncle, Hermenegildo Roa, the liberal bishop of Asunción.{{sfn|Flores|1992|p=736}}
    His uncle's extensive personal library provided the young Roa Bastos with his first exposure to the classical Spanish literature of the Baroque and Renaissance traditions that he would imitate in his early poetry throughout the 1930s and 1940s.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=17}}
    In addition, his uncle's emphasis on the mystical aspects of classic literature would have a profound Roa Bastos' later writings.{{sfn|Flores|1992|p=736}}
    His experience of Guaraní social customs and language combined with the traditional Spanish education that he received in Asunción, created a cultural and linguistic duality that would manifest itself in much of Roa Bastos' writing.{{sfn|Caistor|2005}}
    His rural upbringing also exposed Roa Bastos to the exploitation and oppression of the indigenous and peasant peoples of Paraguay,{{sfn|King|1983|p=16}}
    which would become a prominent theme in his writing. === War and writing (1932–1947) === In 1932 the territorial [[Chaco War]] began between [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] and continued until 1935. At some point, perhaps as late as 1934, Roa Bastos
    joined the Paraguayan army as a medical auxiliary.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=11}}
    The war would have a profound effect on the future writer who said: "when I left for that war I dreamed of purification in the fire of battles."{{sfn|Flores|1992|p=736}}
    Instead of glory he found "maimed bodies" and "destruction" which left him to question "why two brother countries like Bolivia and Paraguay were massacring each other", and as a consequence Roa Bastos became a pacifist.{{sfn|Flores|1992|p=736}}
    Directly after the war he worked as a bank clerk and later as a journalist. During this time he began writing plays and poetry. In 1941 Roa Bastos won the Ateneo Paraguayo prize for ''Fulgencia Miranda'', although the book was never published. In the
    early 1940s he spent significant time on the yerba mate plantations in northern Paraguay, an experience he would later draw upon in his first published novel, ''Hijo de hombre'' (''1960; Son of Man'').{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=17}}
    In 1942 he was appointed editorial secretary for the Asunción daily ''El País''. In 1944 the [[British Council]] awarded Roa Bastos a nine-month fellowship for journalism in [[London]]. During this time he traveled extensively in Britain, France and
    Africa and witnessed the devastation of WWII first hand. He served as the ''El País'' war correspondent, notably conducting an interview with General [[Charles de Gaulle]] after the latter's return to Paris in 1945. Roa Bastos also broadcast Latin
    American programs at the invitation of the BBC and France's Ministry of Information.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=17}}
    Throughout this eventful period in his life Roa Bastos continued to write and he was considered a poet of the Paraguayan ''avant garde''.{{sfn|Flores|1992|p=737}}
    In 1942 he published a book of poems in the classic Spanish style, which he titled ''El Ruiseñor De La Aurora'' (''The Dawn Nightingale''), a work he later renounced.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=18}}
    He also had plays successfully performed during the 1940s, though they were never published. Of his prolific poetry of the late 1940s only "El naranjal ardiente" (1960; "The Burning Orange Grove") was published.{{sfn|Ward|1978|p=500}}
    === Exile in Argentina (1947–1976) === During the 1947 [[Paraguayan Civil War (1947)|Paraguayan Civil War]], Roa Bastos was forced to flee to [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, because he had spoken out against President [[Higinio Moríñigo]]. About 500,000
    of his fellow Paraguayans left for Argentina at the same time.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=19}}
    Roa Bastos remained in Argentina until just before the establishment of the military dictatorship there in 1976, and he did not return permanently to Paraguay until 1989. He found exile difficult, but his time in Buenos Aires was a prolific period.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=19}}
    Roa Bastos said this in reference to his exile:
    <blockquote>
      I can't complain...Exile brought out in me, in addition to a revulsion against violence and against depreciation of the human condition, a feeling for the universality of man. Exile lent me perspectives from which to know my own country from other
      people's point of view, and from which to live for the enormity of its misfortune.{{sfn|Flores|1992|p=737}}
    </blockquote>
    In 1953 the collection of 17 short stories ''[[El trueno entre las hojas (book)|El trueno entre las hojas]]'' (1953; ''Thunder Among the Leaves'') was published and circulated internationally, but it was not until the 1960 publication of the novel
    ''[[Hijo de hombre]]'' (''Son of Man'') that Roa Bastos won major critical and popular success.{{sfn|Caistor|2005}}
    The novel draws on the oppressive history of Paraguay from the rule of Dr. Jose Gaspar de Francia in the early 19th century until the Chaco War in the 1930s. Its [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrative]] perspectives and historical and political
    themes anticipate his most famous work, ''[[Yo, el Supremo]]'', written more than a decade later. Roa Bastos adapted ''Hijo de hombre'' into an award-winning film in the same year as its publication. Roa Bastos further established himself as a
    screenwriter with the screenplay of ''[[Shunko]]'' (1960), directed by [[Lautaro Murúa]] and based on the memoirs of a country school teacher. In 1961 he once again collaborated with Murúa for ''[[Alias Gardelito]]'' (1961), which depicted the lives
    of urban petty criminals and became a major independent film of the ''nuevo cine'' movement.{{sfn|Barnard|Rist|1996|pp=32–33}}
    In 1974 Roa Bastos published his influential masterpiece ''[[Yo, el Supremo]]'', the result of seven years' work. When [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]'s military dictatorship came to power in 1976, however, the book was banned in Argentina, and Roa Bastos
    was exiled once again, this time to [[Toulouse]], France. === France (1976–1989) === In Toulouse Roa Bastos taught Guaraní and Spanish literature at the [[University of Toulouse]].{{sfn|Caistor|2005}}
    Although he had been allowed to visit Paraguay to work with a new generation of Paraguayan writers, starting in 1970, he was again barred from entry in 1982, for purportedly engaging in subversive activities.{{sfn|Marcos|1989|p=1212}}
    There is however, little evidence that he participated in sectarian politics of any kind.{{sfn|Marcos|1992|p=487}}
    In France, Roa Bastos faced the second forced relocation of his life, but he also won a new readership for his work during this time. Helen Lane's English translation of ''Yo, el Supremo'', ''I, The Supreme'', published in 1986, was greeted with
    widespread acclaim in the English-speaking world. However, in France, Roa Bastos' writing focus was primarily academic, and his literary output did not match that of his time in Argentina. In 1985 Roa Bastos retired from the University of Toulouse.{{sfn|Flores|1992|p=737}}
    Following the downfall of the oppressive [[Alfredo Stroessner]] regime in 1989, Roa Bastos returned to Paraguay at the request of its new leader [[Andrés Rodríguez (President)|Andrés Rodríguez]].{{sfn|Ryan|1991|p=405}}
    === Return to Paraguay and Cervantes Prize (1989–2005) === Following the toppling of the Stroessner regime, Roa Bastos won the [[Premio Cervantes]] (Cervantes Prize), awarded by the [[Spanish Royal Academy]] in partnership with the Spanish
    government, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to Spanish-language literature. It was at this time that Roa Bastos began to travel frequently between Paraguay and France.{{sfn|Caistor|2005}}
    In 1991, representing Paraguay, Roa Bastos signed ''The Morelia Declaration'' "demanding the reversal of the ecological destruction of the planet."{{sfn|Flores|1992|p=739}}
    It was at this time that Roa Bastos again became an active novelist and screenwriter. In 1991 Roa Bastos adapted ''Yo, el Supremo'' for the screen. His first novel since ''Yo, el Supremo'', ''Vigilia del admirante'' (1992; ''Vigil of the Admiral'')
    was published in 1992, and ''El fiscal'' (1993; ''The Prosecutor'') the following year. Although neither of his later novels had the impact of his earlier work, ''El fiscal'' is considered an important work. Roa Bastos died on 26 April 2005 in
    [[Asunción]] from a heart attack. He was survived by his three children, his third wife, Iris Giménez, and a reputation as one of Latin American's finest writers.{{sfn|Caistor|2005}}
    == Major works == === ''Hijo de hombre'' ===
    {{main article|Hijo de hombre}}
    ''Hijo de hombre'' (1960; ''Son of Man''), Roa Bastos' first published and award-winning novel, represents his definitive break with poetry.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=38}}
    It is seen as a refined "outgrowth" of his earlier works of short fiction such as ''El trueno entre las hojas'' (1953), which also dealt with themes of political oppression and social struggle in Paraguay.{{sfn|Ryan|1991|p=404}}
    This novel portrays the conflict between the governing [[élite]] and the oppressed masses in Paraguay from 1912 until just after the end of the Chaco War with Bolivia in 1936.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=40}}
    Like his later ''Yo, el Supremo'', ''Hijo de hombre'' draws upon a series of Paraguayan legends and stories dating back to start of Dr. Francia's dictatorship in 1814.{{sfn|Ryan|1991|p=404}}
    ''Hijo de hombre'' builds upon a system of Christian metaphors as part of the Neobaroque concept of [[Magic Realism]], in order to examine the pain of being Paraguayan.{{sfn|Marcos|1992|p=487}}
    This novel contrasts two figures: Miguel Vera and Cristóbal Jara. Vera narrates the odd chapters, although he might also be the narrator of all nine chapters (this is unclear).{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=40}}
    He is a well-to-do and educated romantic supporter of revolution, who is unable to take real action to support his ideals and in the end betrays them (not unlike Judas).{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=39}}
    Jara, on the other hand, is an uneducated "son of man" who becomes a Christ-like leader for Paraguayan people through action and strength of character. Although it was a massive critical success, Roa Bastos remained dissatisfied with the work for a
    number reasons.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=38}}
    It was fourteen years before he published another novel. === ''Yo, el Supremo'' ===
    {{main article|Yo, el Supremo}}
    [[File:José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia.jpg|left|thumb| Roa Bastos portrayed the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]] in his novel ''Yo, el Supremo''.]] ''Yo, el Supremo'' (''I, the Supreme'') is a fictionalized
    account of the 19th-century Paraguayan dictator [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]], who was also known as "Dr. Francia". The book's title derives from the fact that Francia referred to himself as "El Supremo" or "The Supreme." The first in a long
    line of dictators, The Supreme was a severe, calculating despot.{{sfn|Hoyt Williams|1979|p=99}}
    He ruled absolutely from 1814 until his death in 1840, and is a unique figure in Latin American history. The goal of his rule mirrored that of the Jesuits who had ruled Paraguay for much of its history before him: to keep the Paraguayan people and
    their customs pure by protecting them from the corrupting influence of European and other outside forces.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=2}}
    In ''Yo, el supremo'', Roa Bastos is also fundamentally concerned with the power (and the weakness) of writing itself: its plot revolves around the dictator's efforts to uncover who has been forging his signature on a series of [[pasquinade]]s
    discovered around the capital, and his relationship with his secretary, Patiño, to whom he dictates his thoughts and orders, but whom he never fully trusts. The novel itself is "an exceptional cultural phenomenon." It has been suggested that it "[is]
    more immediately and unanimously acclaimed than any novel since ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', [and the] strictly historical importance [may] be even greater than that of García Márquez's fabulously successful creation."{{sfn|Martin|1989|p=278}}
    ''Yo, el supremo'' has contributed widely to a number of different genres and styles. It belongs to the genre of ''novelas de dictadores'' or [[dictator novel]]s, and also to the [[Latin American Boom]], a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Fuentes|1986}}
    ''Yo, el supremo'' is also an important milestone in the evolution of the historical novel genre.{{sfn|Tobia|1997|p=423}}
    "Yo, el supremo weaves a plethora of formats into a single work: history, novel, sociological essay, moral philosophy, [[biographical novel]], revolutionary pamphlet, testimonial documentary, poetic prose, autobiographic confession, ideological
    debate over literary limits, and linguistic treatise on the limits of verbal expression."{{sfn|De Costa|1997|p=186}}
    === ''El Fiscal'' ===
    {{main article|El Fiscal}}
    ''El Fiscal'' (1993; ''The Prosecutor''), is the third novel of the trilogy written by Augusto Roa Bastos. These three works contemplate what the author has termed “the monotheism of power.” The Prosecutor explores the atrocities of the Alfredo
    Stroessner dictatorship in Paraguay, which lasted from 1954 to 1989. The novel links the protagonist to Paraguay’s past as he struggles to give meaning to his life by assassinating the dictator and freeing the Paraguayan people. Combining
    autobiography, detective fiction, historical novel and philosophy, the novel examines the question of whether one man has the right to judge another. Helene Carol Weldt-Basson’s translation was published in 2018 (Fairleigh Dickinson University Press;
    Annotated edition (February 20, 2018)); she is professor of Spanish and Latin American literature at University of North Dakota. == Precursors and influences == Ruy Díaz de Guzmán's ''Anales del descubrimiento, población y conquista del Río de la
    Plata'', is considered one of the most important antecedents to Roa Bastos' writings.{{sfn|Marcos|1989|p=1209}}
    Guzmán, a Paraguayan explorer of Guaraní and Spanish heritage, wrote extensively about the geography of Paraguay using mythical descriptions of the landscape and the Guaraní language. The most important precursor to Roa Bastos, however, is Rafael
    Barrett (1876–1910), whose writings incorporated many of the important themes and writings styles that Roa Bastos would later master including: Spanish-Guaraní bilingualism, magic realism, the revision of Paraguayan history, social literature,
    exploration of collective memory and the universe of poetic symbols.{{sfn|Marcos|1989|p=1210}}
    Barrett's essay "Lo que son los yerbales" is a severe critique of the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] on ''yerba mate'' tea plantations. Roa Bastos spent part of the early 1940s documenting this same issue and there is much
    speculation about the role of "Lo que son los yerbales" in the creation of his first major novel ''Hijo de hombre''.{{sfn|Lewis|1997a|p=102}}
    The Uruguayan writer [[Horacio Quiroga]] is another important predecessor.{{sfn| Foster|1969|p=18}}
    == Style == Roa Bastos was an exponent of the Neobaroque style that brought Latin American literature to the fore internationally in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Marcos|1992|p=485}}
    Among others, the Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]] is also associated with this school of writing. The style uses a complex system of metaphors that are often very closely tied to the land, flora and culture of the particular writer, especially in the
    case of Roa Bastos. [[Magic realism]] is a Neobaroque concept that applies such systems of metaphor to otherwise realistic settings (''Yo, el Supremo'' being a notable example of the form).{{sfn|Marcos|1992|p=487}}
    The Neobaroque style was used by many Paraguayan writers in exile after 1947 and until the 1980s.{{sfn|Marcos|1989|pp=1211–1212}}
    At the core of much of the work from this group are ideas of political freedom and the emancipation of their homeland.{{sfn|Marcos|1992|p=486}}
    Roa Bastos started out writing poetry in the Spanish Renaissance and Baroque traditions. Later he took on "a new sensibility" in response to the poetry of [[Valle-Inclán]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], and [[García Lorca]].{{sfn|Foster|1969|p=11}}
    However, it is as a prose-fiction writer Roa Bastos has built his considerable reputation, through his novels and numerous short stories.{{sfn|Lewis|1997b|p=717}}
    Roa Bastos' novels blend the present and past by creating scenes with myths from pre-colonial times and Christian legends, developing a special kind of Magic Realism, although there are significant stylistic variations between his major novels.{{sfn|Marcos|1992|p=487}}
    == Themes == === Paraguay: collective memory === The majority of Roa Bastos' work was written in exile owing to the oppressive political condition of his country, at a time when Paraguay was one of the least culturally, economically, and politically
    developed countries in Latin America. Thus, much of Roa Bastos' important writing is an attempt to "capture the tragic essence, the 'inner weakness' as well as the inner strength of his country's people."{{sfn|Foster|1969|p=19}}
    His work reveals an intense preoccupation not only with contemporary Paraguay but with its history, looking back to the beginning of the 19th century and the rule of Dr. Gaspar de Francia (whose life is the focus of ''Yo, el Supremo'').{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=24}}
    While key historical figures and events interest Roa Bastos, it is the impact of these "socio-historical roots" on "the nature of the masses" that forms the central theme of his literary work.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=25}}
    His writing deploys symbols and multiple narratives that build on the collective memory of the Paraguayan people.{{sfn|Shaw|2002|pp=137–39}}
    ''Hijo de hombre'', for example, constructs an "alternative history of popular movements" out of the people's recollections and symbols.{{sfn|Franco|1994|p=331}}
    The intertextual novel ''Yo, el Supremo'' is particularly representative of this technique, both in its construction and narrative.{{sfn|Shaw|2002|pp=137–39}}
    In ''El Fiscal'' (1993), a third novel about the abuses of political power—this time focusing on Stroessner's régime—Roa Bastos again offers an alternative to the accepted versions of events in Paraguay and challenges "the intelligibility of
    history". To this end he weaves elements of fantasy and metafiction into his narratives.{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=139}}
    === Humanism and the engaged writer === Roa Bastos believed that it was the role of the writer to directly engage in the interpretation of both contemporary and historical events. Rather than be the objective "chronicler", he thought the writer
    should engage morally with the social problems depicted in the writing.{{sfn|Foster|1969|p=14}}
    According to Roa Bastos, ”literary activity has come to signify the necessity for facing up to a destiny, the will to enlist in the vital reality of a collectivity, in its true moral context and social structure, in the complex relationships of a
    contemporary reality&nbsp;– that is to say, by projecting themselves toward a universal world of man.”{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=21}}
    Thus, one of the major themes in the writing of Roa Bastos is a deep and universal humanism, with a particular focus on suffering{{sfn|Flores|1992|p=737}}
    Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own experiences played a significant role in his emphasis on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in ''Hijo de hombre''. Later he saw the devastation
    of WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, ''El Trueno entre las Hojas'', set the stage for ''Hijo de
    hombre'' and ''Yo, el Supremo'' with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression.{{sfn|Ryan|1991|p=404}}
    Two decades later, ''Yo, el Supremo'' was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos' idea of the ''engaged writer''. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a
    time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism.{{sfn|Shaw|2002|pp=137–38}}
    Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach.{{sfn|Shaw|2002|pp=137–39}}
    Together, these writers created the [[Dictator novel]] genre. === Bilingualism === As is customary for most Paraguayans of peasant or working class origins, Roa Bastos learned to speak Spanish and Guaraní from birth.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=16}}
    Both Spanish and Guaraní are the official languages of Paraguay (the latter is primarily an oral language). Although Guaraní remains the "popular" language spoken at home and on the "street", Spanish is the language of official business and of power.{{sfn|Mendez-Faith|1997|p=619}}
    The preservation and widespread use of an indigenous language after centuries of European immigration is unique in Latin America, and Guarani remains a symbol of Paraguayan nationalism and an "important vehicle for interpreting the country's
    reality".{{sfn|Mendez-Faith|1997|p=619}}
    This is the legacy of the Jesuits who ruled Paraguay in the 18th century and used Guarani (instead of Spanish or Latin) to spread Christianity throughout Paraguay.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=21}}
    While Roa Bastos wrote primarily in Spanish, the interplay between these two languages is an essential part of his style. His bilingualism gives Roa Bastos a much greater range of language to work with, but also creates tension between an
    internationally recognized language and one that is obscure and fiercely Paraguayan.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=16}}
    Roa Bastos has described the relationship between the two languages as "an almost schizophrenic split not only on communicational levels of the spoken language, but also and quite particularly in the literary language."{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=16}}
    == Honors and distinctions == Over the course of his career, Roa Bastos received a diversity of honors and distinctions. In 1941 he won the Ateneo Paraguayo Prize for his (unpublished) novel ''Fulgencio Miranda''.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=18}}
    This first award was followed by a British Council fellowship for journalism that enabled him to travel to Europe during World War II. In 1959 Roa Bastos won the Losada prize for his first published novel ''Hijo de hombre''. The adaptation of this
    novel, for which he wrote the screenplay, won best film in the Spanish language and first prize of the Argentine Instituto de Cinematografia the following year.{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=11}}
    His most prestigious awards were a 1971 John Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship for creative writers,{{sfn|Foster|1978|p=11}}
    and in 1989, the Cervantes Prize, an award given by the Spanish government for lifetime achievement, and Spanish language literature's most prestigious prize. Roa Bastos donated most of his prize money to provide easier access to books in Paraguay.{{sfn|Bach|1996}}
    In 1997 France distinguished him as Chevalier of the [[Legion_of_Honour|Legion d'Honneur]]. == Legacy == The writing of Roa Bastos spans four countries, six decades, and countless genres. In his lifetime he made important contributions to Latin
    American Boom writing,{{sfn|Levinson|2002|pp=3–4}}
    to the related Dictator Novel,{{sfn|Wood|1996|p=395}}
    and to the ''Nuevo Cine'' film movement through screenplays like ''Alias Gardelito'' (1961).{{sfn|Barnard|Rist|1996|pp=32–33}}
    Roa Bastos' influence can be found in the works of many foreign post-boom writers, including [[Mempo Giardinelli]], [[Isabel Allende]], [[Eraclio Zepeda]], [[Antonio Skármeta]], [[Saul Ibargoyen]], and [[Luisa Valenzuela]].{{sfn|Marcos|1989|p=1212}}
    The most important author to come out of Paraguay, he also remains highly influential for a new generation of Paraguayan authors.{{sfn|Seymour-Smith|1985|p=943}}
    Roa Bastos' relationship with his country, unbroken by over 40 years of exile, was considered so important that in 1989 he was invited back by Paraguay's new president, [[Andrés Rodríguez (President)|Andrés Rodríguez]], following the collapse of the
    Stroessner regime.{{sfn|Ryan|1991|p=405}}
    Even before ''Yo, el Supremo'', Roa Bastos was considered part of "the pantheon of great writers" by some critics, due to ''Hijo de hombre''.{{sfn|Flores|1992|p=737}}
    However, it was the former work that cemented his place as a significant literary figure. According to Juan Manuel Marcos, ''Yo, el Supremo'' "anticipates many of the post-boom writing techniques" such as "the carnivalization of historical discourse,
    transtextualization, and parody".{{sfn|Marcos|1992|p=487}}
    Mexican literary great, [[Carlos Fuentes]] has called ''Yo, el Supremo'' one of the milestones in Latin American literature.{{sfn|Ryan|1991|p=405}}
    While his reputation rests on his novels, Roa Bastos' achievements in film, creative writing, and journalism add further substance to his legacy. == Published works ==

    | signature = Edgar Allan Poe Signature.svg | imagesize = }} '''Edgar Allan Poe''' ({{IPAc-en|p|oʊ}}; born '''Edgar Poe'''; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, poet, editor, and [[literary criticism|literary critic]]. Poe is
      best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of [[Romanticism]] in the United States, and of American literature. Poe was one of the country's earliest
      practitioners of the [[short story]], and considered to be the inventor of the [[detective fiction]] genre, as well as a significant contributer to the emerging genre of [[science fiction]].<ref>{{harvnb|Stableford|2003|pp=18–19}}</ref>
    Poe was the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.<ref name="Meyers138"/>
    Poe was born in [[Boston]], the second child of actors [[David Poe Jr.|David]] and [[Eliza Poe|Elizabeth "Eliza" Poe]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edgar Allan Poe's Richmond : the Raven in the River City|last=Semtner|first=Christopher P.|date=2012|publisher=History Press|isbn=978-1-60949-607-4|location=Charleston [SC]|page=15|oclc=779472206}}</ref> His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when his mother died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. He attended the [[University of Virginia]] but left after a year due to lack of money. He quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education, and his gambling debts. In 1827, having enlisted in the [[United States Army]] under an assumed name, he published his first collection ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'', credited only to "a Bostonian". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife in 1829. Poe later failed as an officer cadet at [[West Point]], declared a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and parted ways with Allan. Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for [[literary journal]]s and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In 1836, he married his 13-year-old cousin, [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]], but she died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1847. In January 1845, Poe published his poem "[[The Raven]]" to instant success. He planned for years to produce his own journal ''The Penn'' (later renamed ''[[The Stylus]]''), but before it could be produced, [[Death of Edgar Allan Poe|he died in Baltimore]] on October 7, 1849, at age 40, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of his death remains unknown, and has been variously attributed to many causes including disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide.<ref name="Meyers256"/> Poe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as [[cosmology]] and [[cryptography]]. He and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The [[Mystery Writers of America]] present an annual award known as the [[Edgar Award]] for distinguished work in the mystery genre. == Early life == [[File:Edgar Allan Poe Birthplace Boston.jpg|thumb|Plaque in [[Boston]] marking the approximate location of Poe's birth]] Edgar Poe was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], on January 19, 1809, the second child of [[England|English]]-born actress [[Eliza Poe|Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe]] and actor [[David Poe Jr.]] He had an elder brother named [[William Henry Leonard Poe]] and a younger sister named Rosalie Poe.<ref name=Allen>{{harvnb|Allen|1927|p=}}</ref> Their grandfather, David Poe Sr., emigrated from [[County Cavan]], Ireland, around 1750.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=13}}</ref> Edgar may have been named after a character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'', which the couple were performing in 1809.<ref>{{harvnb|Nelson|1981|p=65}}</ref>
    His father abandoned the family in 1810,<ref>{{harvnb|Canada|1997|p=}}</ref>
    and his mother died a year later from consumption ([[pulmonary tuberculosis]]). Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful merchant in [[Richmond, Virginia]], who dealt in a variety of goods, including cloth, wheat, tombstones,
    tobacco, and slaves.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=8}}</ref>
    The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name "Edgar Allan Poe",<ref name="Meyers9">{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=9}}</ref>
    though they never formally adopted him.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=61}}</ref>
    The Allan family had Poe baptized into the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son.<ref name="Meyers9"/>
    The family sailed to the United Kingdom in 1815, and Poe attended the grammar school for a short period in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], Ayrshire, Scotland (where Allan was born) before rejoining the family in London in 1816. There he studied at
    a boarding school in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby's Manor House School at [[Stoke Newington]], then a suburb
    {{convert|4|mi|km|0}}
    north of London.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=16–18}}</ref>
    Poe moved with the Allans back to Richmond in 1820. In 1824, he served as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as the city celebrated the [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States|visit of the Marquis de Lafayette]].<ref>{{harvnb|PoeMuseum.org|2006}}</ref>
    In March 1825, Allan's uncle and business benefactor William Galt died, who was said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond,<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=20}}</ref>
    leaving Allan several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000 ({{Inflation|US|750000|1825|fmt=eq|r=-6}}).{{Inflation/fn|US}}
    By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick house called Moldavia.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=27–28}}</ref>
    Poe may have become engaged to [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] before he registered at the [[University of Virginia]] in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=29–30}}</ref>
    <ref>University of Virginia. ''A Catalogue of the Officers and Students of the University of Virginia. Second Session, Commencing February 1st, 1826''. Charlottesville, VA: Chronicle Steam Book Printing House, 1880, p. 10</ref>
    The university was in its infancy, established on the ideals of its founder [[Thomas Jefferson]]. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were mostly ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student
    self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=21–22}}</ref>
    During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. He claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a
    dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=32–34}}</ref>
    Poe gave up on the university after a year but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married another man, Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with
    odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer,<ref name="Meyers32">{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=32}}</ref>
    and he started using the [[pseudonym]] Henri Le Rennet during this period.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=41}}</ref>
    == Military career == [[File:FtIndependence2.jpg|left|thumb|Poe was first stationed at Boston's [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] while in the Army.]] Poe was unable to support himself, so he enlisted in the [[United States
    Army]] as a private on May 27, 1827, using the name "Edgar A. Perry". He claimed that he was
    {{nowrap|22 years old}}
    even though he was 18.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|p=13}}</ref>
    He first served at [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] in [[Boston Harbor]] for five&nbsp;dollars a month.<ref name="Meyers32"/>
    That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry titled ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'', attributed with the byline "by a Bostonian". Only 50&nbsp;copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=33–34}}</ref>
    Poe's regiment was posted to [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and traveled by ship on the brig ''Waltham'' on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to "artificer", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for artillery, and had his
    monthly pay doubled.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=35}}</ref>
    He served for two&nbsp;years and attained the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank that a non-commissioned officer could achieve); he then sought to end his five-year enlistment early. Poe revealed his real name and his
    circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard, who would only allow Poe to be [[military discharge|discharged]] if he reconciled with Allan. Poe wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic and spent several months ignoring Poe's
    pleas; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, Allan agreed to support Poe's
    attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], New York.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=43–47}}</ref>
    Poe was finally discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=38}}</ref>
    Before entering West Point, he moved back to Baltimore for a time to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Eliza Clemm]] (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth
    Cairnes Poe.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|pp=13–14}}</ref>
    In September of that year, Poe received "the very first words of encouragement I ever remember to have heard"<ref>{{harvnb|Sears|1978|p=114, quoting a letter from Poe to Neal}}</ref>
    in a review of his poetry by influential critic [[John Neal (writer)|John Neal]], prompting Poe to dedicate one of the poems to Neal<ref>{{harvnb|Lease|1972|p=130}}</ref>
    in his second book ''Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems'', published in Baltimore in 1829.<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=5}}</ref>
    Poe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830.<ref>{{harvnb|Krutch|1926|p=32}}</ref>
    In October 1830, Allan married his second wife Louisa Patterson.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|p=14}}</ref>
    The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of extramarital affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=54–55}}</ref>
    Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting [[court-martial]]ed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. He tactically pleaded not guilty
    to induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.<ref>{{harvnb|Hecker|2005|pp=49–51}}</ref>
    Poe left for New York in February 1831 and released a third volume of poems, simply titled ''Poems.'' The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75&nbsp;cents to the cause, raising a total of $170. They
    may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones that Poe had been writing about commanding officers.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=50–51}}</ref>
    It was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as "Second Edition," and including a page saying, "To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated". The book once again reprinted the long poems "Tamerlane" and "Al Aaraaf" but also
    six previously unpublished poems, including early versions of "[[To Helen]]", "[[Poems by Edgar Allan Poe#Israfel (1831)|Israfel]]", and "[[The City in the Sea]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Hecker|2005|pp=53–54}}</ref>
    Poe returned to Baltimore to his aunt, brother, and cousin in March 1831. His elder brother Henry had been in ill health, in part due to problems with alcoholism, and he died on August 1, 1831.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|pp=187–188}}</ref>
    ==Publishing career== After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest attempts to start his career as a writer, but he chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so.<ref>{{harvnb|Whalen|2001|p=64}}</ref>
    He was one of the first Americans to live by writing alone<ref name="Meyers138">{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=138}}</ref>
    <ref name="Quinn305">{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=305}}</ref>
    and was hampered by the lack of an international [[copyright law]].<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=247}}</ref>
    American publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans.<ref name="Quinn305"/>
    The industry was also particularly hurt by the [[Panic of 1837]].<ref>{{harvnb|Whalen|2001|p=74}}</ref>
    There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=99}}</ref>
    Publishers often refused to pay their writers or paid them much later than they promised,<ref>{{harvnb|Whalen|2001|p=82}}</ref>
    and Poe repeatedly resorted to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=139}}</ref>
    [[File:VirginiaPoe.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Poe (age 26) obtained a license in 1835 to marry his cousin [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]] (age 13). They were married for 11 years until her death, which may have inspired some of his
    writing.]] After his early attempts at poetry, Poe had turned his attention to prose, likely based on John Neal's critiques in ''[[The Yankee]]'' magazine.<ref>{{harvnb|Lease|1972|p=132}}</ref>
    He placed a few stories with a [[Philadelphia]] publication and began work on his only drama ''[[Politian (play)|Politian]]''. The ''[[Baltimore Saturday Visiter]]'' awarded him a prize in October 1833 for his short story "[[MS. Found in a Bottle]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=162}}</ref>
    The story brought him to the attention of [[John P. Kennedy]], a Baltimorean of considerable means who helped Poe place some of his stories and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' in Richmond. Poe
    became assistant editor of the periodical in August 1835,<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=225}}</ref>
    but White discharged him within a few weeks for being drunk on the job.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=73}}</ref>
    Poe returned to Baltimore where he obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were married at that time.<ref name="Silverman 1991 124">{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=124}}</ref>
    He was 26 and she was 13. Poe was reinstated by White after promising good behavior, and he went back to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the ''Messenger'' until January 1837. During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation
    increased from 700 to 3,500.<ref name="Allen"/>
    He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia held a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] wedding ceremony at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm's age as
    21.<ref name="Silverman 1991 124"/>
    <ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=85}}</ref>
    Poe's novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' was published and widely reviewed in 1838.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=137}}</ref>
    In the summer of 1839, Poe became assistant editor of ''[[Burton's Gentleman's Magazine]]''. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic which he had established at the ''Messenger''. Also in
    1839, the collection ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' was published in two volumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=113}}</ref>
    In June 1840, Poe published a [[prospectus (book)|prospectus]] announcing his intentions to start his own journal called ''[[The Stylus]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=119}}</ref>
    although he originally intended to call it ''The Penn'', as it would have been based in Philadelphia. He bought advertising space for his prospectus in the June 6, 1840 issue of Philadelphia's ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'': ''"Prospectus of the Penn
    Magazine, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of Philadelphia by Edgar A. Poe."''<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=159}}</ref>
    The journal was never produced before Poe's death. Poe left ''Burton's'' after about a year and found a position as writer and co-editor at the then-very-successful monthly ''[[Graham's Magazine]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|pp=39, 99}}</ref>
    In the last number of ''Graham's'' for 1841, Poe was among the co-signatories to an editorial note of celebration of the tremendous success that magazine had achieved in the past year: "Perhaps the editors of no magazine, either in America or in
    Europe, ever sat down, at the close of a year, to contemplate the progress of their work with more satisfaction than we do now. Our success has been unexampled, almost incredible. We may assert without fear of contradiction that no periodical ever
    witnessed the same increase during so short a period."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Graham |first1=George |last2=Embury |first2=E. |last3=Peterson |first3=Charles |last4=Stephens |first4=A. |last5=Poe |first5=Edgar |date=December 1841 |title=The Closing Year |url=https://archive.org/details/grahamsmagazine1819grah |magazine=Graham's Magazine |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=George R.

    an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=144}}</ref>
    Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=187}}</ref>
    Poe was promised an appointment, but all positions were filled by others.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=188}}</ref>
    [[File:P1020279.JPG|thumb|left|Cottage in [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]] (now [[the Bronx]]) where Poe spent his last years]] One evening in January 1842, Virginia showed the first signs of consumption, now known as [[tuberculosis]], while singing and

    She only partially recovered, and Poe began to drink more heavily under the stress of her illness. He left ''Graham's'' and attempted to find a new position, for a time angling for a government post. He returned to New York where he worked briefly at

    On January 29, 1845, his poem "[[The Raven]]" appeared in the ''Evening Mirror'' and became a popular sensation. It made Poe a household name almost instantly,<ref>{{harvnb|Hoffman|1998|p=80}}</ref>
    though he was paid only $9 for its publication.<ref>{{harvnb|Ostrom|1987|p=5}}</ref>

    and Poe moved to a cottage in [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham, New York]], in what is now [[the Bronx]]. That home is now known as the [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage]], relocated to a park near the southeast corner of the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand
    Concourse]] and Kingsbridge Road. Nearby, Poe befriended the [[Jesuits]] at St. John's College, now [[Fordham University]].<ref>Schroth, Raymond A. ''Fordham: A History and Memoir''. New York: Fordham University Press, 2008: 22–25.</ref>

    Biographers and critics often suggest that Poe's frequent theme of the "death of a beautiful woman" stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his wife.<ref>{{harvnb|Weekes|2002|p=149}}</ref>
    Poe was increasingly unstable after his wife's death. He attempted to court poet [[Sarah Helen Whitman]] who lived in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe's drinking and erratic behavior. There is also
    strong evidence that Whitman's mother intervened and did much to derail their relationship.<ref>{{harvnb|Benton|1987|p=19}}</ref>
    Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=628}}</ref>

    {{Main|Death of Edgar Allan Poe}}
    On October 3, 1849, Poe was found delirious on the streets of Baltimore, "in great distress, and… in need of immediate assistance", according to Joseph W. Walker, who found him.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=638}}</ref>
    He was taken to the [[Church Home and Hospital|Washington Medical College]], where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849, at 5:00 in the morning.<ref name="Meyers255">{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=255}}</ref>
    Poe was not coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition and was wearing clothes that were not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the name "Reynolds" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to
    whom he was referring. Some sources say that Poe's final words were, "Lord help my poor soul".<ref name="Meyers255"/>
    All medical records have been lost, including Poe's [[death certificate]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bramsback|1970|p=40}}</ref>
    Newspapers at the time reported Poe's death as "congestion of the brain" or "cerebral inflammation", common euphemisms for death from disreputable causes such as alcoholism.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=435–436}}</ref>
    The actual cause of death remains a mystery.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=435}}</ref>

    ===Griswold's "Memoir"=== Immediately after Poe's death, his literary rival [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] wrote a slanted high-profile obituary under a pseudonym, filled with falsehoods that cast him as a lunatic and a madman, and which described him as
    a person who "walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips moving in indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate prayers, (never for himself, for he felt, or professed to feel, that he was already damned)".<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Luling|first=Todd|title=A Vengeful Arch-Nemesis Taught You Fake News About Edgar Allan Poe|date=January 19, 2017|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/edgar-allen-poe-obituary_n_587d4b0de4b03549ebc02172|website=Huffington Post|access-date=July 23, 2019}}</ref>
    The long obituary appeared in the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' signed "Ludwig" on the day that Poe was buried. It was soon further published throughout the country. The piece began, "Edgar Allan Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore the day before yesterday.
    This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it."<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=259}}
      To read Griswold's full obituary, see [[s:Death of Edgar Allan Poe|Edgar Allan Poe obituary]] at Wikisource.</ref>
    "Ludwig" was soon identified as Griswold, an editor, critic, and anthologist who had borne a grudge against Poe since 1842. Griswold somehow became Poe's [[literary estate|literary executor]] and attempted to destroy his enemy's reputation after his
    death.<ref name="Hoffman14">{{harvnb|Hoffman|1998|p=14}}</ref>
    Griswold wrote a biographical article of Poe called "Memoir of the Author", which he included in an 1850 volume of the collected works. There he depicted Poe as a depraved, drunken, drug-addled madman and included Poe's letters as evidence.<ref name="Hoffman14"/>
    Many of his claims were either lies or distortions; for example, it is seriously disputed that Poe was a drug addict.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=693}}</ref>
    Griswold's book was denounced by those who knew Poe well,<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=101}}</ref>
    including John Neal, who published an article defending Poe and attacking Griswold as a "[[Rhadamanthus]], who is not to be bilked of his fee, a thimble-full of newspaper notoriety".<ref>{{harvnb|Lease|1972|p=194, quoting Neal}}</ref>
    Griswold's book nevertheless became a popularly accepted biographical source. This was in part because it was the only full biography available and was widely reprinted, and in part because readers thrilled at the thought of reading works by an
    "evil" man.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=263}}</ref>
    Letters that Griswold presented as proof were later revealed as [[forgery|forgeries]].<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=699}}</ref>
    ==Literary style and themes== [[File:Edgar Allan Poe by Samuel S Osgood, 1845.png|thumb|upright|1845 portrait by [[Samuel Stillman Osgood]]]] ===Genres=== Poe's best known fiction works are [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]],<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=64}}</ref>
    adhering to the genre's conventions to appeal to the public taste.<ref name="Royot57">{{harvnb|Royot|2002|p=57}}</ref>
    His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of [[decomposition]], concerns of [[premature burial]], the reanimation of the dead, and mourning.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1987|p=3}}</ref>
    Many of his works are generally considered part of the [[dark romanticism]] genre, a literary reaction to [[transcendentalism]]<ref>{{harvnb|Koster|2002|p=336}}</ref>
    which Poe strongly disliked.<ref name="ljunquist15">{{harvnb|Ljunquist|2002|p=15}}</ref>
    He referred to followers of the transcendental movement as "Frog-Pondians", after the pond on [[Boston Common]],<ref>{{harvnb|Royot|2002|pp=61–62}}</ref>

    and ridiculed their writings as "metaphor—run mad,"<ref>{{harvnb|Hayes|2002|p=16}}</ref>
    lapsing into "obscurity for obscurity's sake" or "mysticism for mysticism's sake".<ref name="ljunquist15"/>
    Poe once wrote in a letter to [[Thomas Holley Chivers]] that he did not dislike transcendentalists, "only the pretenders and [[sophism|sophists]] among them".<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=169}}</ref>
    Beyond horror, Poe also wrote [[satire]]s, humor tales, and hoaxes. For comic effect, he used irony and ludicrous extravagance, often in an attempt to liberate the reader from cultural conformity.<ref name="Royot57"/>
    "[[Metzengerstein]]" is the first story that Poe is known to have published<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=88}}</ref>
    and his first foray into horror, but it was originally intended as a [[burlesque]] satirizing the popular genre.<ref>{{harvnb|Fisher|1993|pp=142,149}}</ref>
    Poe also reinvented [[science fiction]], responding in his writing to emerging technologies such as hot air balloons in "[[The Balloon-Hoax]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Tresch|2002|p=114}}</ref>
    Poe wrote much of his work using themes aimed specifically at mass-market tastes.<ref>{{harvnb|Whalen|2001|p=67}}</ref>
    To that end, his fiction often included elements of popular [[pseudoscience]]s, such as [[phrenology]]<ref>{{harvnb|Hungerford|1930|pp=209–231}}</ref>
    and [[physiognomy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Grayson|2005|pp=56–77}}</ref>
    ===Literary theory=== Poe's writing reflects his literary theories, which he presented in his criticism and also in essays such as "[[The Poetic Principle]]".<ref name="Krutch225">{{harvnb|Krutch|1926|p=225}}</ref>
    He disliked [[didacticism]]<ref>{{harvnb|Kagle|1990|p=104}}</ref>
    and [[allegory]],<ref>{{harvnb|Poe|1847|pp=252–256}}</ref>
    though he believed that meaning in literature should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface. Works with obvious meanings, he wrote, cease to be art.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilbur|1967|p=99}}</ref>
    He believed that work of quality should be brief and focus on a specific single effect.<ref name="Krutch225"/>
    To that end, he believed that the writer should carefully calculate every sentiment and idea.<ref>{{harvnb|Jannaccone|1974|p=3}}</ref>
    Poe describes his method in writing "The Raven" in the essay "[[The Philosophy of Composition]]", and he claims to have strictly followed this method. It has been questioned whether he really followed this system, however. [[T. S. Eliot]] said: "It
    is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method."<ref>{{harvnb|Hoffman|1998|p=76}}</ref>
    Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as "a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization".<ref>{{harvnb|Krutch|1926|p=98}}</ref>
    == Legacy == [[File:Raven Manet D2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Illustration by French impressionist [[Édouard Manet]] for the [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] translation of "[[The Raven]]", 1875 (digitally restored)]] === Influence === During his lifetime, Poe was
    mostly recognized as a literary critic. Fellow critic [[James Russell Lowell]] called him "the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America", suggesting—rhetorically—that he occasionally
    used [[prussic acid]] instead of ink.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=432}}</ref>
    Poe's caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a "tomahawk man".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edgar Allan Poe: Rhetoric and Style|last=Zimmerman|first=Brett|year=2005|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|isbn=978-0-7735-2899-4|pages=85–87}}</ref> A favorite target of Poe's criticism was Boston's acclaimed poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called "The Longfellow War". Poe accused Longfellow of "the heresy of the didactic", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized.<ref name=Lewis>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Paul|title=Quoth the detective: Edgar Allan Poe's case against the Boston literati|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2011/03/06/quoth_the_detective/?page=full|work=boston.com|publisher=Globe Newspaper Company|access-date=April 9, 2013|date=March 6, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603120501/http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2011/03/06/quoth_the_detective/?page=full|archive-date=June 3, 2013}}</ref>

Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work in Continental Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Harner|1990|p=218}}</ref> Poe's early detective fiction tales featuring [[C. Auguste Dupin]] laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] said, "Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?"<ref>{{harvnb|Frank|Magistrale|1997|p=103}}</ref>
    The [[Mystery Writers of America]] have named their awards for excellence in the genre the "[[Edgar Award|Edgars]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Neimeyer|2002|p=206}}</ref>
    Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably [[Jules Verne]], who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel ''The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket'' called ''[[An Antarctic Mystery]]'', also known as ''The Sphinx of the Ice Fields''.<ref>{{harvnb|Frank|Magistrale|1997|p=364}}</ref>
    Science fiction author [[H. G. Wells]] noted, "''Pym'' tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago".<ref>{{harvnb|Frank|Magistrale|1997|p=372}}</ref>
    In 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' cited ''Pym'' as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Doyle, [[Henry James]], [[B. Traven]], and [[David Morrell]].<ref name="guardian">{{cite news | last = McCrum | first = Robert | title = The 100 best novels: No 10 – The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket by Edgar Allan Poe (1838) | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = November 23, 2013 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/24/arthur-gordon-pym-nantucket-edgar-allan-poe-100-novels | access-date = August 8, 2016 | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160911130937/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/24/arthur-gordon-pym-nantucket-edgar-allan-poe-100-novels | archive-date = September 11, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>
    Horror author and historian [[H. P. Lovecraft]] was heavily influenced by Poe's horror tales, dedicating an entire section of his long essay, "[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]", to his influence on the genre. In his letters, Lovecraft stated,
    "When I write stories, Edgar Allan Poe is my model."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/life/interest/authors.aspx|title=H.P. Lovecraft's Favorite Authors|website=www.hplovecraft.com|access-date=December 3, 2019}}</ref> [[Alfred Hitchcock]] once said, "It's because I liked Edgar Allan Poe's stories so much that I began to make suspense films".<ref>{{cite news | title = Edgar Allan Poe | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = July 22, 2008 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/12/edgarallanpoe | access-date = February 14, 2019 }}</ref> Like many famous artists, Poe's works have spawned imitators.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=281}}</ref>
    One trend among imitators of Poe has been claims by clairvoyants or psychics to be "channeling" poems from Poe's spirit. One of the most notable of these was [[Lizzie Doten]], who published ''Poems from the Inner Life'' in 1863, in which she claimed
    to have "received" new compositions by Poe's spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as "[[The Bells (poem)|The Bells]]", but which reflected a new, positive outlook.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlson|1996|p=476}}</ref>
    [[File:Edgar A. Poe - NARA - 528345 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Poe, in a modern retouched version of the "Ultima Thule" daguerreotype]] Even so, Poe has also received criticism. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal
    character and its influence upon his reputation.<ref name="Meyers258"/>
    [[William Butler Yeats]] was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him "vulgar".<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=274}}</ref>
    Transcendentalist [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] reacted to "The Raven" by saying, "I see nothing in it",<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=265}}</ref>
    and derisively referred to Poe as "the jingle man".<ref>{{harvnb|New York Times|1894}}</ref>
    [[Aldous Huxley]] wrote that Poe's writing "falls into vulgarity" by being "too poetical"—the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger.<ref>{{harvnb|Huxley|1967|p=32}}</ref>
    It is believed that only twelve copies have survived of Poe's first book ''Tamerlane and Other Poems''. In December 2009, one copy sold at [[Christie's|Christie's auctioneers]] in New York City for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American
    literature.<ref>{{harvnb|New York Daily News|2009}}</ref>
    ===Physics and cosmology=== ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem]]'', an essay written in 1848, included a cosmological theory that presaged the [[Big Bang]] theory by 80 years,<ref>{{harvnb|Cappi|1994}}</ref>
    <ref>{{harvnb|Rombeck|2005}}</ref>
    as well as the first plausible solution to [[Olbers' paradox]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harrison|1987|p=}}</ref>
    <ref>{{harvnb|Smoot|Davidson|1994|p=}}</ref>
    Poe eschewed the [[scientific method]] in ''Eureka'' and instead wrote from pure [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].<ref name="Meyers214">{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=214}}</ref>
    For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science,<ref name="Meyers214"/>
    but insisted that it was still true<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=399}}</ref>
    and considered it to be his career masterpiece.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=219}}</ref>
    Even so, ''Eureka'' is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored [[Newton's laws of motion|Newtonian principles]] regarding the density and rotation of planets.<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=82}}</ref>
    === Cryptography === Poe had a keen interest in [[cryptography]]. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper ''Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger'', inviting submissions of [[cipher]]s which he proceeded to solve.<ref name="Silverman152">{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=152}}</ref>
    In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called "A Few Words on Secret Writing" in ''Graham's Magazine''. Capitalizing on public interest in the topic, he wrote "[[The Gold-Bug]]" incorporating ciphers as an essential part of the story.<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenheim|1997|pp=2, 6}}</ref>
    Poe's success with cryptography relied not so much on his deep knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple [[Substitution cipher|substitution cryptogram]]) as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen
    analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage.<ref name="Silverman152"/>
    The sensation that Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.<ref>{{harvnb|Friedman|1993|pp=40–41}}</ref>
    Two ciphers he published in 1841 under the name "W. B. Tyler" were not solved until 1992 and 2000 respectively. One was a quote from [[Joseph Addison]]'s play ''Cato''; the other is probably based on a poem by [[Hester Thrale]].<ref>"Though some
      wondered whether Poe wrote the source text, I find that it previously appeared in the Baltimore Sun of July 4, 1840; and that it was in turn based on a widely reprinted poem (“Nuptial Repartee”) that first appeared in the June 21, 1813, Morning
      Herald of London. A manuscript in the hand of Hester Thrale (i.e., Hester Lynch Piozzi) in Harvard’s library hints that she may be the true author." From ''Edgar Allan Poe: The Fever Called Living'' by Paul Collins. Boston: New Harvest/Houghton

[[William Friedman]], America's foremost cryptologist, was heavily influenced by Poe.<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenheim|1997|p=15}}</ref>

    ==In popular culture== ===As a character===
    {{Main|Edgar Allan Poe in popular culture|Edgar Allan Poe in television and film}}
    The historical Edgar Allan Poe has appeared as a fictionalized character, often representing the "mad genius" or "tormented artist" and exploiting his personal struggles.<ref>{{harvnb|Neimeyer|2002|p=209}}</ref>
    Many such depictions also blend in with characters from his stories, suggesting that Poe and his characters share identities.<ref>{{harvnb|Gargano|1967|p=165}}</ref>
    Often, fictional depictions of Poe use his mystery-solving skills in such novels as ''[[The Poe Shadow]]'' by [[Matthew Pearl]].<ref>{{harvnb|Maslin|2006}}</ref>

    {{anchor|Preserved homes, landmarks, and museums}}
    [[File:PoeNHS.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site]] in Philadelphia is one of several preserved former residences of Poe.]] No childhood home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family's Moldavia estate. The
    oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the [[Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond)|Edgar Allan Poe Museum]], though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used during his time with the Allan
    family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is the dorm room that Poe is believed to have used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is now
    overseen by a group of students and staff known as the [[Raven Society]].<ref>{{harvnb|The Raven Society|2014}}</ref>
    The earliest surviving home in which Poe lived is in Baltimore, preserved as the [[Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum]]. Poe is believed to have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia (as well as his
    grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe).<ref>{{harvnb|Edgar Allan Poe Society|2007}}</ref>
    It is open to the public and is also the home of the Edgar Allan Poe Society. Of the several homes that Poe, his wife Virginia, and his mother-in-law Maria rented in Philadelphia, only the last house has survived. The Spring Garden home, where the
    author lived in 1843–1844, is today preserved by the [[National Park Service]] as the [[Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2006}}</ref>

    Other Poe landmarks include a building on the [[Upper West Side]] where Poe temporarily lived when he first moved to New York. A plaque suggests that Poe wrote "The Raven" here. On Sullivan's Island in Charleston, South Carolina, the setting of Poe's
    tale "The Gold-Bug" and where Poe served in the Army in 1827 at Fort Moultrie, there is a restaurant called Poe's Tavern. In [[Fell's Point, Baltimore]], a bar still stands where legend says that Poe was last seen drinking before his death. Now known
    as "The Horse You Came in On", local lore insists that a ghost whom they call "Edgar" haunts the rooms above.<ref>{{harvnb|Lake|2006|p=195}}</ref>

    Notable among them are: * "Ultima Thule" ("far discovery") to honor the new photographic technique; taken in November 1848 in Providence, Rhode Island, probably by Edwin H. Manchester * "Annie", given to Poe's friend Annie L. Richmond; probably taken
    in June 1849 in Lowell, Massachusetts, photographer unknown ===Poe Toaster===
    {{Main|Poe Toaster}}
    Between 1949 and 2009, a bottle of [[cognac]] and three roses were left at Poe's original grave marker every January 19 by an unknown visitor affectionately referred to as the "Poe Toaster". Sam Porpora was a historian at the Westminster Church in
    Baltimore where Poe is buried, and he claimed on August 15, 2007, that he had started the tradition in 1949. Porpora said that the tradition began in order to raise money and enhance the profile of the church. His story has not been confirmed,<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2007}}</ref>
    and some details which he gave to the press are factually inaccurate.<ref>{{harvnb|Associated Press|2007}}</ref>

          number of pen names, most notably '''Ed McBain''', used for most of his [[crime fiction]]. Born '''Salvatore Albert Lombino''', he legally adopted the name Evan Hunter in 1952; he also used the pen names John Abbott, Curt Cannon, Hunt Collins, Ezra
          Hannon, and Richard Marsten, amongst others. His [[87th Precinct]] novels have become staples of the [[police procedural]] genre. ==Life== ===Early life=== Salvatore Lombino was born and raised in New York City. He lived in East [[Harlem]] until age
          12, when his family moved to the [[Bronx]]. He attended Olinville Junior High School, then Evander Childs High School, before winning an Art Students League scholarship. Later, he was admitted as an art student at [[Cooper Union]]. Lombino served in
          the [[United States Navy|Navy]] in World War II and wrote several short stories while serving aboard a [[destroyer]] in the Pacific. However, none of these stories was published until after he had established himself as an author in the 1950s. After
          the war, Lombino returned to New York and attended [[Hunter College]], where he majored in English and psychology, with minors in dramatics and education, and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He published a weekly column in the Hunter College newspaper
          as "S. A. Lombino". In 1981, Lombino was inducted into the Hunter College Hall of Fame, where he was honored for outstanding professional achievement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.hunter.cuny.edu/pdf/archives/AlumniFindingAid.pdf|website=Hunter.cuny.edu|title=Alumni Finding Aid|access-date=2010-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613130426/http://library.hunter.cuny.edu/pdf/archives/AlumniFindingAid.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>
          While looking to start a career as a writer, Lombino took a variety of jobs, including 17 days as a teacher at Bronx Vocational High School in September 1950. This experience would later form the basis for his novel ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'' (1954),
          written under the pen name Evan Hunter. In 1951, Lombino took a job as an executive editor for the Scott Meredith Literary Agency, working with authors such as [[Poul Anderson]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], [[Lester del Rey]], [[Richard S. Prather]], and
          [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. He made his first professional [[short story]] sale that same year, a science-fiction tale titled "Welcome, Martians!", credited to S. A. Lombino.<ref>McBain, Ed, Learning To Kill, Harvest Books, 2006, pg. xi-xii</ref>
          ===Name change and pen names===
          {{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
          Soon after his initial sale, Lombino sold stories under the [[pen name]]s Evan Hunter and Hunt Collins. The name ''Evan Hunter'' is generally believed to have been derived from two schools he attended, Evander Childs High School and Hunter College,
          although the author himself would never confirm that. (He did confirm that Hunt Collins was derived from Hunter College.) Lombino legally changed his name to Evan Hunter in May 1952, after an editor told him that a novel he wrote would sell more
          copies if credited to Evan Hunter than to S. A. Lombino. Thereafter, he used the name Evan Hunter both personally and professionally. [[File:Evan Hunter 5312.jpg|thumb|Evan Hunter c. 1953]] As Evan Hunter, he gained notice with his novel ''Blackboard
          Jungle'' (1954) dealing with juvenile crime and the New York City public school system. [[Blackboard Jungle|The film adaptation]] followed in 1955. During this era, Hunter also wrote a great deal of genre fiction. He was advised by his agents that
          publishing too much fiction under the Hunter byline, or publishing ''any'' crime fiction as Evan Hunter, might weaken his literary reputation. Consequently, during the 1950s Hunter used the pseudonyms Curt Cannon, Hunt Collins, and Richard Marsten
          for much of his crime fiction. A prolific author in several genres, Hunter also published approximately two dozen science fiction stories and four science-fiction novels between 1951 and 1956 under the names S. A. Lombino, Evan Hunter, Richard
          Marsten, D. A. Addams, and Ted Taine. Ed McBain, his best known pseudonym, was first used with ''[[Cop Hater]]'' (1956), the first novel in the [[87th Precinct]] crime series. Hunter revealed that he was McBain in 1958 but continued to use the
          pseudonym for decades, notably for the 87th Precinct series, and the [[Matthew Hope]] detective series. He retired the pen names Addams, Cannon, Collins, Marsten, and Taine around 1960. From then on crime novels were generally attributed to McBain
          and other sorts of fiction to Hunter. Reprints of crime-oriented stories and novels written in the 1950s previously attributed to other pseudonyms were re-issued under the McBain byline. Hunter stated that the division of names allowed readers to
          know what to expect: McBain novels had a consistent writing style, while Hunter novels were more varied. Under the Hunter name, novels steadily appeared throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s, including ''Come Winter'' (1973) and ''Lizzie''
          (1984). Hunter was also successful as screenwriter for film and television. He wrote the screenplay for the [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] film ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963), loosely adapted from [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s eponymous [[The
          Birds (story)|1952 novelette]]. In the process of adapting [[Winston Graham]]'s novel ''[[Marnie]]'' (1961) for Hitchcock, Hunter and the director disagreed on the rape scene, and the writer was sacked. Hunter's other screenplays included
          ''[[Strangers When We Meet (film)|Strangers When We Meet]]'' (1960), based on his own 1958 novel; and ''[[Fuzz (film)|Fuzz]]'' (1972), based on his eponymous 1968 87th Precinct novel, which he had written as Ed McBain. From 1958 until his death,
          McBain's 87th Precinct novels appeared at a rate of approximately one or two novels a year. Additionally, [[NBC]] ran a police drama called ''[[87th Precinct (TV series)|87th Precinct]]'' during the 1961–62 season, based on McBain's work. From 1978
          to 1998, McBain published a series about lawyer Matthew Hope; books in this series appeared every year or two, and usually had titles derived from well-known children's stories. For about a decade, from 1984 to 1994, Hunter published no fiction under
          his own name. In 2000, a novel called ''Candyland'' appeared that was credited to both Hunter ''and'' McBain. The two-part novel opened in Hunter's psychologically-based narrative voice before switching to McBain's customary [[police procedural]]
          style. Aside from McBain, Hunter used at least two other pseudonyms for his fiction after 1960: ''Doors'' (1975), which was originally attributed to Ezra Hannon, before being reissued as a work by McBain, and ''Scimitar'' (1992), which was credited
          to John Abbott. Hunter gave advice to other authors in his article, "Dig in and get it done: no-nonsense advice from a prolific author (aka Ed McBain) on starting and finishing your novel". In it, he advised authors to "find their voice for it is the
          most important thing in any novel".<ref>"Dig in and get it done"; Evan Hunter. ''The Writer''. Boston: Jun 2005. Vol. 118, Issue 6</ref>
          ===Dean Hudson controversy=== Hunter has long been rumoured to have written an unknown number of pornographic novels, as Dean Hudson, for William Hamling's publishing houses. Hunter himself adamantly and consistently denied writing any books as
          Hudson right up to his death. However, apparently his agent [[Scott Meredith]] sold books to Hamling's company as Hunter's work, and received payments for these books in cash. While notable, this in and of itself is not definitive proof: Meredith
          almost certainly forwarded novels to Hamling by any number of authors, claiming these novels were by Hunter simply to make a sale. Ninety-three novels were published under the Hudson name between 1961 and 1969, and even the most avid proponents of
          the Hunter-as-Hudson theory do not believe Hunter is responsible for all 93.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://efanzines.com/EK/eI24/index.htm#jungle |title=The Whitewash Jungle|author=Kemp, Earl |website=Earl Kemp fanzine|date= February 2006}}</ref>

      |signature = Ernest Hemingway Signature.svg }} '''Ernest Miller Hemingway''' (July 21, 1899&nbsp;– July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer, journalist, and sportsman. His economical and understated style—which he termed the
      [[iceberg theory]]—had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous lifestyle and his public image brought him admiration from later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he
      was awarded the [[1954 Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two nonfiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story collections, and three nonfiction works were published posthumously. Many of
      his works are considered classics of [[American literature]]. Hemingway was raised in [[Oak Park, Illinois]]. After high school, he was a reporter for a few months for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' before leaving for the [[Italian Front (World War
      I)|Italian Front]] to enlist as an ambulance driver in [[World War I]]. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1929). In 1921, he married [[Hadley
      Richardson]], the first of four wives. They moved to Paris where he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the [[modernist]] writers and artists of the 1920s' "[[Lost Generation]]" expatriate community. Hemingway's [[debut
      novel]] ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'' was published in 1926. He divorced Richardson in 1927, and married [[Pauline Pfeiffer]]. They divorced after he returned from the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939), which he covered as a journalist and which was the
      basis for his novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1940). [[Martha Gellhorn]] became his third wife in 1940. He and Gellhorn separated after he met [[Mary Welsh Hemingway|Mary Welsh]] in London during [[World War II]]. Hemingway was present with
      Allied troops as a journalist at the [[Normandy landings]] and the [[liberation of Paris]]. He maintained permanent residences in [[Key West, Florida]] (in the 1930s) and in [[Cuba]] (in the 1940s and 1950s). He almost died in 1954 after plane
      crashes on successive days, with injuries leaving him in pain and ill health for much of the rest of his life. In 1959, he bought a [[Ernest and Mary Hemingway House|house in Ketchum, Idaho]], where, in mid-1961, he committed suicide. == Life == ===
      Early life === [[File:ErnestHemingwayBabyPicture.jpg|thumb|upright|Hemingway was the second child and first son born to Clarence and Grace.]] Ernest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], an affluent suburb just west
      of Chicago,<ref>Oliver (1999), 140</ref>
      to Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and [[Grace Hall Hemingway]], a musician.<!-- <ref name="Reynolds pp 17-18"/> -->
      His parents were well-educated and well-respected in Oak Park,<ref name="Reynolds pp 17-18">Reynolds (2000), 17–18</ref>
      a conservative community about which resident [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] said, "So many churches for so many good people to go to."<ref>Meyers (1985), 4</ref>
      When Clarence and Grace Hemingway married in 1896, they [[Birthplace of Ernest Hemingway|lived with Grace's father]], Ernest Miller Hall,<ref>Oliver (1999), 134</ref>
      after whom they named their first son, the second of their six children.<ref name="Reynolds pp 17-18"/>
      His sister Marcelline preceded him in 1898, followed by Ursula in 1902, Madelaine in 1904, Carol in 1911, and [[Leicester Hemingway|Leicester]] in 1915.<ref name="Reynolds pp 17-18"/>
      Grace followed the Victorian convention of not differentiating children's clothing by gender. With only a year separating the two, Ernest and Marcelline resembled one-another strongly. Grace wanted them to appear as twins, so in Ernest's first three
      years she kept his hair long and dressed both children in similarly frilly feminine clothing.<ref>Meyers (1985), 9</ref>
      [[File:Ernest Hemingway with Family, 1905.png|thumb|left|The Hemingway family in 1905 (from the left): Marcelline, Sunny, Clarence, Grace, Ursula, and Ernest]] Hemingway's mother, a well-known musician in the village,<ref name="Reynolds 2000 19">Reynolds (2000), 19</ref>
      taught her son to play the cello despite his refusal to learn; though later in life he admitted the music lessons contributed to his writing style, evidenced for example in the "[[contrapuntal]] structure" of ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.<ref>Meyers (1985), 3</ref>
      As an adult Hemingway professed to hate his mother, although biographer Michael S. Reynolds points out that he shared similar energies and enthusiasms.<ref name="Reynolds 2000 19"/>
      Each summer the family traveled to [[Ernest Hemingway Cottage|Windemere]] on [[Walloon Lake]], near [[Petoskey, Michigan]]. There young Ernest joined his father and learned to hunt, fish, and camp in the woods and lakes of [[Northern Michigan]],
      early experiences that instilled a life-long passion for outdoor adventure and living in remote or isolated areas.<ref name="Beegel2000, p. 63-70">Beegel (2000), 63–71</ref>
      Hemingway attended [[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] in Oak Park from 1913 until 1917. He was a good athlete, involved with a number of sports—boxing, track and field, water polo, and football; performed in the school orchestra for two years
      with his sister Marcelline; and received good grades in English classes.<ref name="Reynolds 2000 19"/>
      During his last two years at high school he edited the ''Trapeze'' and ''Tabula'' (the school's newspaper and yearbook), where he imitated the language of sportswriters and used the [[pen name]] Ring Lardner Jr.—a nod to [[Ring Lardner]] of the
      ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' whose byline was "Line O'Type".<ref name="Meyers p19ff"/>
      Like [[Mark Twain]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], and [[Sinclair Lewis]], Hemingway was a journalist before becoming a novelist. After leaving high school he went to work for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' as a cub reporter.<ref name="Meyers p19ff">Meyers (1985), 19–23</ref>

    The Hemingways returned to Pamplona in 1924 and a third time in June 1925; that year they brought with them a group of American and British expatriates: Hemingway's [[Michigan]] boyhood friend Bill Smith, Donald Ogden Stewart, [[Duff Twysden|Lady
    Duff Twysden]] (recently divorced), her lover Pat Guthrie, and [[Harold Loeb]].<ref name="Nagel89ff">Nagel (1996), 89</ref>
    A few days after the fiesta ended, on his birthday (July 21), he began to write the draft of what would become ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', finishing eight weeks later.<ref name="Meyers p189">Meyers (1985), 189</ref>
    A few months later, in December 1925, the Hemingways left to spend the winter in [[Schruns]], Austria, where Hemingway began revising the manuscript extensively. Pauline Pfeiffer joined them in January and against Hadley's advice, urged Hemingway to
    sign a contract with [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]]. He left Austria for a quick trip to New York to meet with the publishers, and on his return, during a stop in Paris, began an affair with Pfeiffer, before returning to Schruns to finish the
    revisions in March.<ref>Reynolds (1989), vi–vii</ref>
    The manuscript arrived in New York in April; he corrected the final proof in Paris in August 1926, and Scribner's published the novel in October.<ref name="Meyers p189"/>

    received good reviews and is "recognized as Hemingway's greatest work".<ref name="Meyers p192">Meyers (1985), 192</ref>
    Hemingway himself later wrote to his editor [[Max Perkins]] that the "point of the book" was not so much about a generation being lost, but that "the earth abideth forever"; he believed the characters in ''The Sun Also Rises'' may have been
    "battered" but were not lost.<ref name="Baker p82">Baker (1972), 82</ref>

    On their return to Paris, Hadley asked for a separation; in November she formally requested a divorce. They split their possessions while Hadley accepted Hemingway's offer of the proceeds from ''The Sun Also Rises''.<ref>Mellow (1992), 338–340</ref>
    The couple were divorced in January 1927, and Hemingway married Pfeiffer in May.<ref name="Meyers p172">Meyers (1985), 172</ref>
    [[File:Ernest and Pauline Hemingway, Paris, 1927.jpg|thumb|Ernest and [[Pauline Pfeiffer|Pauline]] Hemingway in Paris, 1927]] Pfeiffer, who was from a wealthy [[Catholic]] [[Arkansas]] family, had moved to Paris to work for ''[[Vogue

    They honeymooned in [[Le Grau-du-Roi]], where he contracted [[anthrax]], and he planned his next collection of short stories,<ref>Mellow (1992), 348–353</ref>
    ''[[Men Without Women (short story collection)|Men Without Women]]'', which was published in October 1927,<ref name="Meyers p195">Meyers (1985), 195</ref>
    and included his [[boxing]] story "[[Fifty Grand]]". ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine editor-in-chief [[Ray Long]] praised "Fifty Grand", calling it, "one of the best short stories that ever came to my hands&nbsp;... the best
    prize-fight story I ever read&nbsp;... a remarkable piece of realism."<ref>Long (1932), 2–3</ref>
    By the end of the year Pauline, who was pregnant, wanted to move back to America. John Dos Passos recommended [[Key West]], and they left Paris in March 1928. Hemingway suffered a severe injury in their Paris bathroom when he pulled a skylight down
    on his head thinking he was pulling on a toilet chain. This left him with a prominent forehead scar, which he carried for the rest of his life. When Hemingway was asked about the scar, he was reluctant to answer.<ref>Robinson (2005)</ref>
    After his departure from Paris, Hemingway "never again lived in a big city".<ref name="Meyers p204">Meyers (1985), 204</ref>

    Hemingway and Pauline traveled to Kansas City, where their son [[Patrick Hemingway|Patrick]] was born on June 28, 1928. Pauline had a difficult delivery; Hemingway fictionalized a version of the event as a part of ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]''. After
    Patrick's birth, Pauline and Hemingway traveled to Wyoming, Massachusetts, and New York.<ref name="Meyers p208">Meyers (1985), 208</ref>
    In the winter, he was in New York with Bumby, about to board a train to Florida, when he received a cable telling him that his father had killed himself.<ref group="note">Clarence Hemingway used his father's Civil War pistol to shoot himself. See Meyers (1985), 2</ref>
    <ref>Mellow (1992), 367</ref>
    Hemingway was devastated, having earlier written to his father telling him not to worry about financial difficulties; the letter arrived minutes after the suicide. He realized how Hadley must have felt after her own father's suicide in 1903, and he
    commented, "I'll probably go the same way."<ref>qtd. in Meyers (1985), 210</ref>
    Upon his return to Key West in December, Hemingway worked on the draft of ''A Farewell to Arms'' before leaving for France in January. He had finished it in August but delayed the revision. The serialization in ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]'' was
    scheduled to begin in May, but as late as April, Hemingway was still working on the ending, which he may have rewritten as many as seventeen times. The completed novel was published on September 27.<ref name="Meyers p215">Meyers (1985), 215</ref>
    Biographer [[James R. Mellow|James Mellow]] believes ''A Farewell to Arms'' established Hemingway's stature as a major American writer and displayed a level of complexity not apparent in ''The Sun Also Rises''.(The story was turned into a play by war
    veteran [[Laurence Stallings]] which was the basis for the film starring [[Gary Cooper]].)<ref name="Mellow p378">Mellow (1992), 378</ref>
    In Spain in mid-1929, Hemingway researched his next work, ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]''. He wanted to write a comprehensive [[treatise]] on bullfighting, explaining the ''toreros'' and ''corridas'' complete with glossaries and appendices, because he
    believed bullfighting was "of great tragic interest, being literally of life and death."<ref>Baker (1972), 144–145</ref>
    During the early 1930s, Hemingway spent his winters in Key West and summers in Wyoming, where he found "the most beautiful country he had seen in the American West" and hunted deer, elk, and grizzly bear.<ref name="Meyers p222">Meyers (1985), 222</ref>
    He was joined there by Dos Passos, and in November 1930, after bringing Dos Passos to the train station in [[Billings, Montana]], Hemingway broke his arm in a car accident. The surgeon tended the compound spiral fracture and bound the bone with
    kangaroo tendon. Hemingway was hospitalized for seven weeks, with Pauline tending to him; the nerves in his writing hand took as long as a year to heal, during which time he suffered intense pain.<ref>Reynolds (2000), 31</ref>

    While in Key West, Hemingway frequented the local bar [[Sloppy Joe's (bar)|Sloppy Joe's]].<ref name="Mellow p402">Mellow (1992), 402</ref>
    He invited friends—including [[Waldo Peirce]], Dos Passos, and [[Max Perkins]]<ref>Mellow (1992), 376–377</ref>—to join him on fishing trips and on an all-male expedition to the [[Dry Tortugas]]. Meanwhile, he continued to traveltoEuropeandtoCuba,and—although in 1933 he wrote of Key West, "We have a fine house here, and kids are all well"—Mellow believes he "was plainly restless".<ref name="Mellow p424">Mellow (1992), 424</ref>
    In 1933, Hemingway and Pauline went on safari to Kenya. The 10-week trip provided material for ''[[Green Hills of Africa]]'', as well as for the short stories "[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (short story)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]" and "[[The Short
    Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]".<ref name="Desnoyers p9">Desnoyers, 9</ref>
    The couple visited [[Mombasa]], [[Nairobi]], and [[Machakos]] in Kenya; then moved on to [[Tanganyika Territory]], where they hunted in the [[Serengeti]], around [[Lake Manyara]], and west and southeast of present-day [[Tarangire National Park]].
    Their guide was the noted "white hunter" [[Philip Percival]] who had guided [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on his 1909 safari. During these travels, Hemingway contracted [[amoebic dysentery]] that caused a prolapsed intestine, and he was evacuated by plane
    to Nairobi, an experience reflected in "The Snows of Kilimanjaro". On Hemingway's return to Key West in early 1934, he began work on ''Green Hills of Africa'', which he published in 1935 to mixed reviews.<ref>Mellow (1992), 337–340</ref>

    Dos Passos left the project after the execution of [[José Robles]], his friend and Spanish translator,<ref name="Meyers p308ff">Meyers (1985), 308–311</ref>
    which caused a rift between the two writers.<ref name="Koch p164">Koch (2005), 164</ref>
    Hemingway was joined in Spain by journalist and writer Martha Gellhorn, who he had met in Key West a year earlier. Like Hadley, Martha was a St. Louis native, and like Pauline, she had worked for ''Vogue'' in Paris. Of Martha, Kert explains, "she
    never catered to him the way other women did".<ref name="Kert pp287">Kert (1983), 287–295</ref>
    In July 1937 he attended the Second International Writers' Congress, the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war, held in [[Valencia]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Madrid]] and attended by many writers including [[André
    Malraux]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Pablo Neruda]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Hugh |title=The Spanish Civil War |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-141-01161-5 |page=678 |edition=50th Anniversary}}</ref>
    Late in 1937, while in Madrid with Martha, Hemingway wrote his only play, ''[[The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories|The Fifth Column]]'', as [[Siege of Madrid|the city was being bombarded]] by Francoist forces.<ref name="Koch p134">Koch (2005), 134</ref>
    He returned to Key West for a few months, then back to Spain twice in 1938, where he was present at the [[Battle of the Ebro]], the last republican stand, and he was among the British and American journalists who were some of the last to leave the
    battle as they crossed the river.<ref name="Meyers p321">Meyers (1985), 321</ref>

    === Cuba === In early 1939, Hemingway crossed to Cuba in his boat to live in the [[Hotel Ambos Mundos]] in Havana. This was the separation phase of a slow and painful split from Pauline, which began when Hemingway met Martha Gellhorn.<ref name="Meyers p326">Meyers (1985), 326</ref>
    Martha soon joined him in Cuba, and they rented "[[Finca Vigía]]" ("Lookout Farm"), a

    from Havana. Pauline and the children left Hemingway that summer, after the family was reunited during a visit to Wyoming; when his divorce from Pauline was finalized, he and Martha were married on November 20, 1940, in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]].<ref>Lynn (1987), 479</ref>

    Hemingway moved his primary summer residence to [[Ketchum, Idaho]], just outside the newly built resort of [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]], and moved his winter residence to Cuba.<ref name="Meyers p342">Meyers (1985), 342</ref>
    He had been disgusted when a Parisian friend allowed his cats to eat from the table, but he became enamored of cats in Cuba and kept dozens of them on the property.<ref name="Meyers p353">Meyers (1985), 353</ref>
    Descendants of his cats live at his [[Key West]] home. Gellhorn inspired him to write his most famous novel, ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'', which he began in March 1939 and finished in July 1940. It was published in October 1940.<ref name="Meyers p334">Meyers (1985), 334</ref>
    His pattern was to move around while working on a manuscript, and he wrote ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' in Cuba, Wyoming, and Sun Valley.<ref name="Meyers p326"/>
    It became a Book-of-the-Month Club choice, sold half a million copies within months, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and, in the words of Meyers, "triumphantly re-established Hemingway's literary reputation".<ref name="Meyers pp334–339">Meyers (1985), 334–338</ref>
    In January 1941, Martha was sent to China on assignment for ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine.<ref name="Meyers pp=356–361"/>
    Hemingway went with her, sending in dispatches for the newspaper ''[[PM (newspaper)|PM]]'', but in general he disliked China.<ref name="Meyers pp=356–361">Meyers (1985), 356–361</ref>

    === World War II === [[File:Hemlatham-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Hemingway with [[Charles T. Lanham|Col. Charles "Buck" Lanham]] in Germany, 1944, during the fighting in Hürtgenwald, after which he became ill with pneumonia.|alt=photograph of two men]]
    Hemingway was in Europe from May 1944 to March 1945. When he arrived in London, he met ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent [[Mary Welsh Hemingway|Mary Welsh]], with whom he became infatuated. Martha had been forced to cross the
    Atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because Hemingway refused to help her get a press pass on a plane, and she arrived in London to find him hospitalized with a concussion from a car accident. She was unsympathetic to his plight; she accused
    him of being a bully and told him that she was "through, absolutely finished".<ref name="Kert pp393-398">Kert (1983), 393–398</ref>
    The last time that Hemingway saw Martha was in March 1945 as he was preparing to return to Cuba,<ref name="Meyers p416">Meyers (1985), 416</ref>
    and their divorce was finalized later that year.<ref name="Kert pp393-398"/>
    Meanwhile, he had asked Mary Welsh to marry him on their third meeting.<ref name="Kert pp393-398"/>
    Hemingway accompanied the troops to the [[Normandy Landings]] wearing a large head bandage, according to Meyers, but he was considered "precious cargo" and not allowed ashore.<ref name="Meyers pp400">Meyers (1985), 400</ref>
    The [[LCVP (United States)|landing craft]] came within sight of [[Omaha Beach]] before coming under enemy fire and turning back. Hemingway later wrote in ''[[Collier's]]'' that he could see "the first, second, third, fourth and fifth waves of
    [landing troops] lay where they had fallen, looking like so many heavily laden bundles on the flat pebbly stretch between the sea and first cover".<ref>Reynolds (1999), 96–98</ref>
    Mellow explains that, on that first day, none of the correspondents were allowed to land and Hemingway was returned to the ''[[USS Dorothea L. Dix (AP-67)|Dorothea Dix]]''.<ref>Mellow (1992), 533</ref>
    <!-- biographer Kenneth Lynn claims that Hemingway fabricated accounts that he went ashore during the landings.<ref>Lynn (1987), 510</ref> -->
    Late in July, he attached himself to "the [[22nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|22nd Infantry Regiment]] commanded by Col. [[Charles T. Lanham|Charles "Buck" Lanham]], as it drove toward Paris", and Hemingway became de facto leader to a small band
    of village militia in [[Rambouillet]] outside of Paris.<ref name="Meyers pp398-405">Meyers (1985), 398–405</ref>
    [[Paul Fussell]] remarks: "Hemingway got into considerable trouble playing infantry captain to a group of Resistance people that he gathered because a correspondent is not supposed to lead troops, even if he does it well."<ref name="Putnam"/>
    This was in fact in contravention of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]], and Hemingway was brought up on formal charges; he said that he "beat the rap" by claiming that he only offered advice.<ref name="Lynn 1987 518–519">Lynn (1987), 518–519</ref>
    On August 25, he was present at the [[liberation of Paris]] as a journalist; contrary to the Hemingway legend, he was not the first into the city, nor did he liberate the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Ritz]].<ref name="Meyers p408ff">Meyers (1985) 408–411</ref>
    In Paris, he visited Sylvia Beach and Pablo Picasso with Mary Welsh, who joined him there; in a spirit of happiness, he forgave Gertrude Stein.<ref name="Mellow p535ff">Mellow (1992), 535–540</ref>
    Later that year, he observed heavy fighting in the [[Battle of Hürtgen Forest]].<ref name="Meyers p408ff"/>
    On December 17, 1944, he had himself driven to Luxembourg in spite of illness to cover [[The Battle of the Bulge]]. As soon as he arrived, however, Lanham handed him to the doctors, who hospitalized him with pneumonia; he recovered a week later, but
    most of the fighting was over.<ref name="Lynn 1987 518–519"/>
    In 1947, Hemingway was awarded a [[Bronze Star]] for his bravery during World War II. He was recognized for having been "under fire in combat areas in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions", with the commendation that "through his talent
    of expression, Mr. Hemingway enabled readers to obtain a vivid picture of the difficulties and triumphs of the front-line soldier and his organization in combat".<ref name="Putnam"/>
    === Cuba and the Nobel Prize === Hemingway said he "was out of business as a writer" from 1942 to 1945 during his residence in Cuba.<ref name="Mellow p552">qtd. in Mellow (1992), 552</ref>
    In 1946 he married Mary, who had an [[ectopic pregnancy]] five months later. The Hemingway family suffered a series of accidents and health problems in the years following the war: in a 1945 car accident, he "smashed his knee" and sustained another
    "deep wound on his forehead"; Mary broke first her right ankle and then her left in successive skiing accidents. A 1947 car accident left Patrick with a head wound and severely ill.<ref name="Meyers pp420–421">Meyers (1985), 420–421</ref>
    Hemingway sank into depression as his literary friends began to die: in 1939 [[William Butler Yeats]] and [[Ford Madox Ford]]; in 1940 [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]; in 1941 Sherwood Anderson and James Joyce; in 1946 Gertrude Stein; and the following year
    in 1947, Max Perkins, Hemingway's long-time Scribner's editor, and friend.<ref name="Mellow pp548–550">Mellow (1992) 548–550</ref>
    During this period, he suffered from severe headaches, high blood pressure, weight problems, and eventually diabetes—much of which was the result of previous accidents and many years of heavy drinking.<ref name="Desnoyers p12">Desnoyers, 12</ref>
    Nonetheless, in January 1946, he began work on ''[[The Garden of Eden (novel)|The Garden of Eden]]'', finishing 800 pages by June.<ref>Meyers (1985), 436</ref>
    <ref group="note">''The Garden of Eden'' was published posthumously in 1986. See Meyers (1985), 436</ref>
    During the post-war years, he also began work on a trilogy tentatively titled "The Land", "The Sea" and "The Air", which he wanted to combine in one novel titled ''The Sea Book''. However, both projects stalled, and Mellow says that Hemingway's
    inability to continue was "a symptom of his troubles" during these years.<ref>Mellow (1992), 552</ref>
    <ref group="note">The manuscript for ''The Sea Book'' was published posthumously as ''[[Islands in the Stream (novel)|Islands in the Stream]]'' in 1970. See Mellow (1992), 552</ref>

    In 1948, Hemingway and Mary traveled to Europe, staying in [[Venice]] for several months. While there, Hemingway fell in love with the then 19-year-old [[Adriana Ivancich]]. The platonic love affair inspired the novel ''[[Across the River and into
    the Trees]]'', written in Cuba during a time of strife with Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews.<ref>Meyers (1985), 440–452</ref>
    The following year, furious at the critical reception of ''Across the River and Into the Trees'', he wrote the draft of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' in eight weeks, saying that it was "the best I can write ever for all of my life".<ref name="Desnoyers p12"/>
    ''The Old Man and the Sea'' became a book-of-the-month selection, made Hemingway an international celebrity, and won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in May 1952, a month before he left for his second trip to Africa.<ref name="Desnoyers p13">Desnoyers, 13</ref>

    <!-- [[File:Ernest Hemingway Kenya safari 1954.png|thumb|Hemingway at a fishing camp in 1954. His hand and arms are burned from a recent bushfire; his hair was burned in the recent plane crashes.]] -->
    In 1954, while in Africa, Hemingway was almost fatally injured in two successive plane crashes. He chartered a sightseeing flight over the [[Belgian Congo]] as a Christmas present to Mary. On their way to photograph [[Murchison Falls]] from the air,
    the plane struck an abandoned utility pole and "crash landed in heavy brush". Hemingway's injuries included a head wound, while Mary broke two ribs.<ref>Baker (1972), 331–333</ref>
    The next day, attempting to reach medical care in [[Entebbe]], they boarded a second plane that exploded at take-off, with Hemingway suffering burns and another concussion, this one serious enough to cause leaking of [[cerebrospinal fluid|cerebral
    fluid]].<ref>Mellow (1992), 586</ref>
    They eventually arrived in Entebbe to find reporters covering the story of Hemingway's death. He briefed the reporters and spent the next few weeks recuperating and reading his erroneous obituaries.<ref>Mellow (1992), 587</ref>
    Despite his injuries, Hemingway accompanied Patrick and his wife on a planned fishing expedition in February, but pain caused him to be irascible and difficult to get along with.<ref name="Mellow 1992 588">Mellow (1992), 588</ref>
    When a bushfire broke out, he was again injured, sustaining second-degree burns on his legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm.<ref name="Meyers pp505-507">Meyers (1985), 505–507</ref>
    Months later in [[Venice]], Mary reported to friends the full extent of Hemingway's injuries: two cracked [[Intervertebral disc|discs]], a kidney and liver rupture, a [[dislocated shoulder]] and a broken skull.<ref name="Mellow 1992 588"/>
    The accidents may have precipitated the physical deterioration that was to follow. After the plane crashes, Hemingway, who had been "a thinly controlled alcoholic throughout much of his life, drank more heavily than usual to combat the pain of his
    injuries."<ref>Beegel (1996), 273</ref>
    [[File:Ernest Hemingway 1950.jpg|thumb|left|Hemingway in the cabin of his boat ''Pilar'', off the coast of Cuba, c. 1950|alt=photograph of a man]] In October 1954, Hemingway received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He modestly told the press that
    [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Isak Dinesen]] and [[Bernard Berenson]] deserved the prize,<ref>Lynn (1987), 574</ref>
    but he gladly accepted the prize money.<ref name="Baker p338">Baker (1972), 38</ref>
    Mellow says Hemingway "had coveted the Nobel Prize", but when he won it, months after his plane accidents and the ensuing worldwide press coverage, "there must have been a lingering suspicion in Hemingway's mind that his obituary notices had played a
    part in the academy's decision."<ref name="Mellow pp588–589">Mellow (1992), 588–589</ref>
    Because he was suffering pain from the African accidents, he decided against traveling to [[Stockholm]].<ref name="Meyers p509">Meyers (1985), 509</ref>
    Instead he sent a speech to be read, defining the writer's life:

Upon re-claiming and opening the trunks, Hemingway discovered they were filled with notebooks and writing from his Paris years. Excited about the discovery, when he returned to Cuba in early 1957, he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''.<ref name="Meyers p533">Meyers (1985), 533</ref> By 1959 he ended a period of intense activity: he finished ''A Moveable Feast'' (scheduled to be released the following year); brought ''True at First Light'' to 200,000 words; added chapters to ''The Garden of Eden''; and worked on ''Islands in the Stream''. The last three were stored in a safe deposit box in Havana, as he focused on the finishing touches for ''A Moveable Feast''. Author Michael Reynolds claims it was during this period that Hemingway slid into depression, from which he was unable to recover.<ref>Reynolds (1999), 321</ref> The Finca Vigía became crowded with guests and tourists, as Hemingway, beginning to become unhappy with life there, considered a permanent move to Idaho. In 1959 he bought a home overlooking the [[Big Wood River]], outside Ketchum, and left Cuba—although he apparently remained on easy terms with the [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] government, telling ''The New York Times'' he was "delighted" with Castro's overthrow of [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]].<ref>Mellow (1992), 494–495</ref><ref name="Meyers pp516–519">Meyers (1985), 516–519</ref> He was in Cuba in November 1959, between returning from Pamplona and traveling west to Idaho, and the following year for his 61st birthday; however, that year he and Mary decided to leave after hearing the news that Castro wanted to nationalize property owned by Americans and other foreign nationals.<ref>Reynolds (2000), 332, 344</ref> On July 25, 1960, the Hemingways left Cuba for the last time, leaving art and manuscripts in a bank vault in Havana.

  [[Henry Louis Gates]] believes Hemingway's style was fundamentally shaped "in reaction to [his] experience of world war". After World War&nbsp;I, he and other modernists "lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization" by reacting
  against the elaborate style of 19th-century writers and by creating a style "in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences—a fiction in which nothing crucial—or at least very little—is stated explicitly."<ref name="Putnam"/>

Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else).<ref>Oliver (1999), 321–322</ref> Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]'', showed he was still experimenting with his writing style.<ref>Smith (1996), 45</ref> He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are [[simple sentence]]s—a childlike syntax without [[subordinate clause|subordination]].<ref>Wells (1975), 130–133</ref> Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with "what if" scenarios: "what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?"<ref>Benson (1989), 351</ref> Writing in "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit."<ref>Hemingway (1975), 3</ref> The simplicity of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to [[Henry James]]'s observation that World War&nbsp;I had "used up words". Hemingway offers a "multi-focal" photographic reality. His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds. The syntax, which lacks [[grammatical conjunction|subordinating conjunctions]], creates static sentences. The photographic "[[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]" style creates a [[collage]] of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences. The sentences build on each other, as events build to create a sense of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an "embedded text" bridges to a different angle. He also uses other cinematic techniques of "cutting" quickly from one scene to the next; or of "splicing" a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from the author and create three-dimensional prose.<ref>Trodd (2007), 8</ref> {{quote box | width = 22em |quote = In the late summer that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains.

    Hemingway habitually used the word "and" in place of commas. This use of [[polysyndeton]] may serve to convey immediacy. Hemingway's polysyndetonic sentence—or in later works his use of subordinate clauses—uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling
    visions and images. Benson compares them to [[haiku]]s.<ref name="McCormick p49">McCormick, 49</ref>
    <ref>Benson (1989), 309</ref>
    Many of Hemingway's followers misinterpreted his lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion; [[Saul Bellow]] satirized this style as "Do you have emotions? Strangle them."<ref>qtd. in Hoberek (2005), 309</ref>
    However, Hemingway's intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray it more scientifically. Hemingway thought it would be easy, and pointless, to describe emotions; he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp "the real thing, the sequence
    of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always".<ref>Hemingway, Ernest. ''Death in the Afternoon''. New York: Simon and Schuster</ref>
    This use of an image as an [[objective correlative]] is characteristic of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and [[Marcel Proust]].<ref>McCormick, 47</ref>

    === Themes === Hemingway's writing includes themes of love, war, travel, wilderness, and loss.<ref>Svoboda (2000), 155</ref>
    Hemingway often wrote about Americans abroad. "In six of the seven novels published during his lifetime," writes Jeffrey Herlihy in ''Hemingway's Expatriate Nationalism'', "the protagonist is abroad, bilingual, and bicultural."<ref name="Herlihy 2011 3">{{cite book |last=Herlihy |first=Jeffrey |title=In Paris or Paname: Hemingway's Expatriate Nationalism |year=2011 |url=https://www.academia.edu/982945 |location=New York |publisher=Rodopi |page=3 |isbn=978-90-420-3409-9}}</ref> Herlihy calls this "Hemingway's Transnational Archetype" and argues that the foreign settings, "far from being mere exotic backdrops or cosmopolitan milieus, are motivating factors in-character action."<ref name="Herlihy 2011 3"/> Critic [[Leslie Fiedler]] sees the theme he defines as "The Sacred Land"—the [[American Old West|American West]]—extended in Hemingway's work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the "Hotel Montana" in ''The Sun Also Rises'' and ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''.<ref name="Fiedler" /> According to Stoltzfus and Fiedler, in Hemingway's work, nature is a place for rebirth and rest; and it is where the hunter or fisherman might experience a moment of transcendence at the moment they kill their prey.<ref name="Stoltzfus" /> Nature is where men exist without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature.<ref name="Fiedler" /> Although Hemingway does write about sports, such as fishing, Carlos Baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport.<ref name="Baker1972 120–121">Baker (1972), 120–121</ref> At its core, much of Hemingway's work can be viewed in the light of American [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], evident in detailed descriptions such as those in "Big Two-Hearted River".<ref name="Beegel2000, p. 63-70" /> Fiedler believes Hemingway inverts the American literary theme of the evil "Dark Woman" versus the good "Light Woman". The dark woman—Brett Ashley of ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''—is a goddess; the light woman—Margot Macomber of "[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]"—is a murderess.<ref name="Fiedler">Fiedler (1975), 345–365</ref> [[Robert Scholes]] says early Hemingway stories, such as "[[A Very Short Story]]", present "a male character favorably and a female unfavorably".<ref>Scholes (1990), 42</ref> According to Rena Sanderson, early Hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction divided women into "castrators or love-slaves". Feminist critics attacked Hemingway as "public enemy number one", although more recent re-evaluations of his work "have given new visibility to Hemingway's female characters (and their strengths) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine."<ref>Sanderson (1996), 171</ref> Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley and Margot Macomber "are the two outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women.{{'"}}<ref>Baym (1990), 112</ref> {{quote box | width = 22em |quote =The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong in the broken places.

(1929) ''A Farewell to Arms''. New York: Scribner's</ref> | style = padding:1.5em | fontsize=85% }} The theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as "[[Indian Camp]]". The theme of death permeates Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in "Indian Camp" was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who kills himself, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a "badly scarred and nervous young man". Hemingway sets the events in "Indian Camp" that shape the Adams persona. Young believes "Indian Camp" holds the "master key" to "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career".<ref>Young (1964), 6</ref> Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in [[existentialism]]: if "nothingness" is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the [[bullfighter]] in the [[Bullfighting|corrida]] represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity.<ref name="Stoltzfus">Stoltzfus (2005), 215–218</ref> In his paper ''The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field'', Timo Müller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an "authentic life", and the "soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature".<ref>Müller (2010), 31</ref> The theme of emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway's work, notably in ''God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen'' and ''The Sun Also Rises''. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained [[Women's suffrage|emancipation]]. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning of ''The Sun Also Rises''. Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times.<ref name="Fiedler" /> In ''God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen'', the emasculation is literal, and related to religious guilt. Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the "natural" versus the "unnatural". In "Alpine Idyll" the "unnaturalness" of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the "unnaturalness" of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the "natural" spring for redemption.<ref name="Baker1972 120–121" /> Descriptions of food and drink feature prominently in many of Hemingway's works. In the short story "[[Big Two-Hearted River]]" Hemingway describes a hungry [[Nick Adams (character)|Nick Adams]] cooking a can of pork and beans and a can of spaghetti over a fire in a heavy cast iron pot. The primitive act of preparing the meal in solitude is a restorative act and one of Hemingway's narratives of post-war integration.<ref>Justice, Hilary Kovar. (2012). "The Consolation of Critique: Food, Culture, and Civilization in Ernest Hemingway". ''The Hemingway review'', Volume 32, issue 1. 16–28</ref> Susan Beegel has written that some more recent critics—writing through the lens of a more modern social and cultural context several decades after Hemingway's death, and more than half a century after his novels were first published—have characterized the social era portrayed in his fiction as [[misogynistic]] and [[homophobic]].<ref name="Beegel 1996 282">Beegel (1996), 282</ref> In her 1996 essay, "Critical Reception", Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism and found that "critics interested in multiculturalism", particularly in the 1980s, simply ignored Hemingway, although some "apologetics" of his work were written.<ref>Beegel (1996), 288</ref> Typical, according to Beegel, is an analysis of Hemingway's 1926 novel, ''The Sun Also Rises'', in which a critic contended: "Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew." Also during the 1980s, according to Beegel, criticism was published that focused on investigating the "horror of [[homosexuality]]" and the "[[racism]]" typical of the social era portrayed in Hemingway's fiction.<ref name="Beegel 1996 282" /> In an overall assessment of Hemingway's work Beegel has written: "Throughout his remarkable body of fiction, he tells the truth about human fear, guilt, betrayal, violence, cruelty, drunkenness, hunger, greed, apathy, ecstasy, tenderness, love and lust."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article294978/Susan-Beegel-What-I-like-about-Hemingway.html|title=Susan Beegel: What I like about Hemingway|website=kansascity.com|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref> == Influence and legacy == [[File:Statue of Hemingway at Floridita.jpg|thumb|Life-sized statue of Hemingway by [[José Villa Soberón]], at [[El Floridita]] bar in [[Havana]]]] Hemingway's legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him either emulated or avoided it.<ref>Oliver (1999), 140–141</ref> After his reputation was established with the publication of ''The Sun Also Rises'', he became the spokesperson for the post-World War&nbsp;I generation, having established a style to follow.<ref name="Nagel 1996 87" /> His books were [[Nazi book burning|burned]] in Berlin in 1933, "as being a monument of modern decadence", and disavowed by his parents as "filth".<ref name="Hallengren">Hallengren, Anders.

        16 November 1906 &nbsp;– 29 July 1973) was a French writer, convicted in 1931 as a murderer by the French courts and pardoned in 1970. He wrote the novel ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'', a memoir of his incarceration in and escape from a [[penal
        colony]] in [[French Guiana]]. While Charrière claimed that ''Papillon'' was largely true, modern researchers believe that much of the book’s material came from other inmates, rather than Charrière himself. Charrière denied committing the murder,
        although he freely admitted to having committed various other petty crimes prior to his incarceration. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Charrière was born at [[Saint-Étienne-de-Lugdarès]], [[Ardèche]], France. He had two older sisters. His mother died
        when he was 10. At 17 in 1923, he enlisted in the [[French Navy]] and served for two years. After that, he became a member of the Paris [[Organized crime|underworld]]. He later married and had a daughter. ===Imprisonment===
          {{Main|Papillon (book)}}
          The version of his life presented in his semi-biographical novel, ''Papillon'', claimed that Charrière was convicted on 26 October 1931 of the murder of a [[pimp]] named Roland Le Petit, a charge that he strenuously denied. He was sentenced to life
          in prison and ten years of [[hard labour]]. He had married Georgette Fourel at the town hall of the 1st arrondissement of Paris, on December 22, 1929. (They divorced on 8 July 1930 by decision of the Paris High Court.) After a brief imprisonment at
          the transit prison of Beaulieu in [[Caen]], France, he was transported in 1933 to the [[prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni]] on the [[Maroni River]], in the penal settlement of mainland [[French Guiana]]. According to the book, he made his first escape
          on 28 November 1933<ref>{{cite book |first=Henri |last=Charrière |title=Papillon |location=London |publisher=[[Rupert Hart-Davis|Hart-Davis]] |date=1970 |isbn=978-0-24663-987-5}}</ref>
          and was joined by fellow prisoners [[André Maturette]] and Joanes Clousiot, who would accompany him throughout much of his time on the run. Thirty-seven days later, the trio were captured by Colombian police near the village of [[Riohacha]], northern
          Caribbean Region of [[Colombia]], and were imprisoned. Charrière subsequently escaped during a rainy night and fled to the [[La Guajira Peninsula]], where he was adopted by an indigenous tribe. He spent several months living with the natives, but
          felt that he had to move on, which was a decision he would ultimately regret. After leaving, he was quickly recaptured and sent back to French Guiana to be put into [[solitary confinement]] for the next two years. After his release from solitary
          confinement, he spent another seven years in prison. During this period he attempted to escape several more times, resulting in increasingly brutal responses from his captors. He stated that he was then confined to [[Devil's Island]], a labour camp
          (Devil's Island was not a labour camp so much as an internment camp) that, at the time, was notorious for being inescapable. (French authorities later released penal colony records that contradicted this; amongst other details, Charrière had never
          been imprisoned on Devil's Island.) However, he finally achieved his permanent liberation in 1941 by using a bag of coconuts as a makeshift raft and, riding the tide out from the island, he escaped with another convict. However, his companion drowned
          in [[quicksand]] when they reached the shore of French Guiana. After meeting up with some escaped Chinese prisoners on the mainland, they bought a boat and sailed to [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[British Guiana]]. After almost a year, a bored
          Charrière then joined another group of escaped convicts in a new boat with the intent of reaching [[British Honduras]]. However, after sailing into a cyclone, they only managed to reach [[Venezuela]]. They were all arrested and sent to a brutal penal
          settlement in [[El Dorado, Venezuela|El Dorado]], [[Bolivar State]]. After a year of imprisonment, Charrière was released with identity papers on 3 July 1944.

          French records of his life from 1933–1944 present a different account: He left the citadel of [[Saint-Martin-de-Ré]] on 29 September 1933 aboard the Martinière and landed on 14 October with the status of "transported" to [[Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni]].
          There was little time left in the transportation camp, as he was assigned as a nursing assistant to the [[André-Bouron Hospital|André-Bouron Colonial Hospital]], where he saw many inmates returning from the run who told him their escape stories, from
          which he drew inspiration. This place spared him from the work of logging sites or agricultural concessions that annihilated convicts in a few months. He escaped for the first time on September 5, 1934, but failed in Colombia, a country that returned
          escaped convicts to France. Judged by the Special Maritime Court, he spent two years in the cells of the St. Joseph's Island Seclusion. Several times transferred, he ended up as chief nurse in an Indochinese camp on the Guyanese mainland, the
          Cascades forest camp, from which he escaped on the night of March 18–19, 1944, along with four companions. ===Later life=== After Charrière had served a year's probationary freedom, he was given his total liberty in 1945. He remained in [[Venezuela]]
          and became a naturalized citizen. He married a Venezuelan woman identified as Rita Bensimon. He opened restaurants in [[Caracas]] and [[Maracaibo]]. He was subsequently treated as a minor celebrity, even being invited frequently to appear on local
          television programmes. He finally returned to France, visiting Paris in conjunction with the publication of his memoir ''Papillon'' (1969). The book sold over 1.5 million copies in France,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Travels with Papi |last=Foote |first=Timothy |date=14 September 1979 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |volume=96 |issue=11 |page=92}}</ref>

          ''Papillon'' was first published in the United Kingdom in 1970, in a translation by the novelist [[Patrick O'Brian]]. Charrière played the part of a jewel thief in a 1970 film called ‘’Popsy Pop’’ directed by the French director [[Jean Vautrin]],
          translated in English as ''The Butterfly Affair''. He also wrote a sequel to ''Papillon'' entitled ''[[Banco (novel)|Banco]]'', in which he describes his life after being released from prison. In 1970, the French Justice System issued a pardon to
          Charrière for his 1931 murder conviction.<ref>{{cite news|title={{'}}''Papillon''{{'}}

          ==Death== On 29 July 1973, Charrière died of [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] in [[Madrid, Spain]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1973-07-31-14-021&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1973-07-31-14|title=Obituary: Henri Charrière|last=Hoyle|first=Ben|date=31 July 1973|newspaper=[[The Times]]|page=14|access-date=13 March 2011|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

          details his alleged numerous escapes, attempted escapes, adventures, and recaptures, from his imprisonment in 1932 to his final escape to Venezuela. The book's title is Charrière's nickname, derived from a [[butterfly]] [[tattoo]] on his chest
          (''papillon'' being French for butterfly). Modern researchers, however, believe that Charrière got much of his story material from other inmates, and so see the work as more of a work of fiction than a true autobiography.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}
          In his book ''Les quatre vérités de Papillon'' ({{lit.}}
          ''The Four Truths of Papillon''), Georges Ménager, a former ''[[Paris Match]]'' reporter, claims that Charrière was in fact a police informer and a pimp before his incarceration, and lived off the proceeds of his girlfriend's prostitution, and that
          he later tried to blame her for the murder of Roland Legrande. Charrière claims to have been incarcerated in Saint Laurent and may have escaped from there, but according to French officials, he never served any time on Devil's Island.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}
          The book and movie both present Devil's Island as having rocky cliffs, when, in fact, although the entire island is rocky, it gently slopes into the surrounding sea. A French justice ministry report said Charrière's book included episodes that were
          imagined or involved others and "should be divided by at least 10 to get near the truth".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1492895/Ex-convict-aged-104-claims-to-be-Papillon.html|title=Ex-convict aged 104 claims to be Papillon|last=Randall|first=Colin|date=27 June 2005|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref>
          In 2005, a 104-year-old man in Paris, [[Charles Brunier]], claimed to be the real Papillon. He also had a butterfly tattoo, on his left arm.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2005-06-26-papillon-alive-and-well-in-a-paris-retirement-home|title=Papillon alive and well in a Paris retirement home|last=Schofield|first=Hugh|date=26 June 2005|newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]]|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref>
          Critics tend to agree that Charrière's depictions included events that happened to others and that Brunier was at the prison at the same time. Critics claim that the heroic rescue of a guard's young daughter from sharks, which Charrière describes
          graphically in his book, was in fact carried out by another convict named Alfred Steffen who lost both legs and subsequently died.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Fabulous Escapes of Papillon: An ex-con from Devil's Island strikes it rich with a great yarn – but how true is it?|last=Wreen|first=Marie-Claude|date=13 November 1970|magazine=[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_4FMEAAAAMBAJ/page/n67 52]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_4FMEAAAAMBAJ|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> When some critics questioned the veracity of his story and said he erred on some of the dates, Charrière replied: "I didn't have a typewriter with me."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19730730&id=Y-VVAAAAIBAJ&pg=5848,6968491|title=Devil's Isle author dies after surgery|date=30 July 1973|newspaper=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> French journalist [[Gerard de Villiers]], author of ''Papillon Épinglé'' (Butterfly Pinned), maintains: "Only about 10 percent of Charrière's book represents the truth."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IPVTAAAAIBAJ&pg=7049,429304&dq=|title=Small-time Paris thief writes a bestseller|date=5 November 1970|newspaper=[[Boca Raton News]]|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> ===Film adaptations=== ''Papillon'' was adapted into the film ''[[Papillon (1973 film)|Papillon]]'' (1973), directed by [[Franklin J.

            He was appalled by the number of deaths involved in warfare,<ref name="AuthorDataSheet"/>
            and left the army after the end of the Crimean War.<ref name="Britannica"/>
            His experience in the army, and two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860–61 converted Tolstoy from a dissolute and privileged society author to a non-violent and spiritual [[Anarchism|anarchist]]. Others who followed the same path were [[Alexander
            Herzen]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]]. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that marked the rest of his life. In a letter to his friend [[Vasily Botkin]], Tolstoy wrote: "The
            truth is that the State is a conspiracy designed not only to exploit, but above all to corrupt its citizens ... Henceforth, I shall never serve any government anywhere."<ref>A.N. Wilson, ''Tolstoy'' (1988), p. 146</ref>
            Tolstoy's concept of [[non-violence]] or [[ahimsa]] was bolstered when he read a [[Tirukkural translations into German|German version]] of the [[Tirukkural]].<ref name="PearlsOfInsp_Rajaram">{{cite book| last = Rajaram| first = M.| title = Thirukkural: Pearls of Inspiration| publisher = Rupa Publications| date = 2009| location = New Delhi | isbn = 978-81-291-1467-9| pages = xviii–xxi}}</ref>

            His European trip in 1860–61 shaped both his political and literary development when he met [[Victor Hugo]]. Tolstoy read Hugo's newly finished ''[[Les Misérables]]''. The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo's novel and Tolstoy's ''[[War and
            Peace]]'' indicates this influence. Tolstoy's political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Tolstoy reviewed Proudhon's
            forthcoming publication, ''La Guerre et la Paix'' ("''War and Peace''" in French), and later used the title for his masterpiece. The two men also discussed education, as Tolstoy wrote in his educational notebooks: "If I recount this conversation with
            Proudhon, it is to show that, in my personal experience, he was the only man who understood the significance of education and of the printing press in our time." Fired by enthusiasm, Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded 13 schools for the
            children of Russia's peasants, who had just been [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipated from serfdom in 1861]]. Tolstoy described the schools' principles in his 1862 essay "The School at Yasnaya Polyana".<ref>{{cite book | last = Tolstoy | first = Lev N. |author2=Leo Wiener |author3=translator and editor | title = The School at Yasnaya Polyana – The Complete Works of Count Tolstoy: Pedagogical Articles.

            Even so, their early married life was happy and allowed Tolstoy much freedom and the support system to compose ''War and Peace'' and ''Anna Karenina'' with Sonya acting as his secretary, editor, and financial manager. Sonya was copying and

            However, their later life together has been described by [[A.N. Wilson]] as one of the unhappiest in literary history. Tolstoy's relationship with his wife deteriorated as his beliefs became increasingly radical. This saw him seeking to reject his
            inherited and earned wealth, including the renunciation of the copyrights on his earlier works. Some of the members of the Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] and the subsequent establishment of the Soviet
            Union, and many of Leo Tolstoy's relatives and descendants today live in Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Tolstoy's son, Count [[Lev Lvovich Tolstoy]], settled in Sweden and married a Swedish woman. Leo Tolstoy's

            == Novels and fictional works == [[File:Leo Tolstoy 1897, black and white, 37767u.jpg|thumb|Tolstoy in 1897]] Tolstoy is considered one of the giants of Russian literature; his works include the novels ''[[War and Peace]]'' and ''[[Anna Karenina]]''
            and novellas such as ''[[Hadji Murat (novel)|Hadji Murad]]'' and ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''. Tolstoy's earliest works, the autobiographical novels [[Childhood (Tolstoy novel)|''Childhood'']], [[Boyhood (novel)|''Boyhood'']], and [[Youth
            (Tolstoy novel)|''Youth'']] (1852–1856), tell of a rich landowner's son and his slow realization of the chasm between himself and his peasants. Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy's own life is revealed. They retain
            their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up. Tolstoy served as a [[second lieutenant]] in an artillery regiment during the [[Crimean War]], recounted in his ''[[Sevastopol Sketches]]''. His experiences in battle helped stir his
            subsequent [[pacifism]] and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.<ref>''Government is Violence: essays on anarchism and pacifism''. Leo Tolstoy – 1990 – Phoenix Press</ref>
            His fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived.<ref>''Tolstoy: the making of a novelist. E'' Crankshaw – 1974 – Weidenfeld & Nicolson</ref>
            ''[[The Cossacks (novel)|The Cossacks]]'' (1863) describes the [[Cossack]] life and people through a story of a Russian aristocrat in love with a Cossack girl. ''Anna Karenina'' (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the
            conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters
            in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in ''War and Peace'', Levin in ''Anna Karenina'' and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in ''Resurrection''.

Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], from the court of [[Alexander I of Russia]] to the battlefields of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]]. Tolstoy's original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the [[Decembrist revolt]], to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that [[Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Andrei Bolkonsky]]'s son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy's theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider ''War and Peace'' to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life.<ref>Tolstoy and the Development of Realism. G Lukacs. ''Marxists on Literature: An Anthology'', London: Penguin, 1977</ref> ''War and Peace'' (which is to Tolstoy really an [[Epic poetry|epic]] in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that ''Anna Karenina'' was his first true novel.<ref>''Tolstoy and the Novel''. J Bayley – 1967 – Chatto & Windus</ref> After ''Anna Karenina'', Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'' (1886) and ''[[What Is to Be Done? (Tolstoy)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' develop a radical [[anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifist]] Christian philosophy which led to his [[excommunication]] from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1901.<ref>''Church and State''. L Tolstoy&nbsp;– On Life and Essays on Religion, 1934</ref> For all the praise showered on ''Anna Karenina'' and ''War and Peace'', Tolstoy rejected the two works later in his life as something not as true of reality.<ref>''Women in Tolstoy: the ideal and the erotic'' R.C. Benson – 1973 – University of Illinois Press</ref> In his novel ''[[Resurrection (Tolstoy novel)|Resurrection]]'', Tolstoy attempts to expose the injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of institutionalized church. Tolstoy also explores and explains the economic philosophy of [[Georgism]], of which he had become a very strong advocate towards the end of his life. Tolstoy also tried himself in poetry with several soldier songs written during his military service and fairy tales in verse such as ''Volga-bogatyr'' and ''Oaf'' stylized as national folk songs. They were written between 1871 and 1874 for his ''Russian Book for Reading'', a collection of short stories in four volumes (total of 629 stories in various genres) published along with the ''New Azbuka'' textbook and addressed to schoolchildren. Nevertheless, he was skeptical about poetry as a genre. As he famously said, "Writing poetry is like ploughing and dancing at the same time". According to [[Valentin Bulgakov]], he criticised poets, including [[Alexander Pushkin]], for their "false" epithets used "simply to make it rhyme".<ref>''Leo Tolstoy (1874)''.

          [[Gustave Flaubert]], on reading a translation of ''War and Peace'', exclaimed, "What an artist and what a psychologist!" [[Anton Chekhov]], who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, "When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and
          pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and
          aspirations invested in literature." The 19th-century British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] opined that "A novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life."<ref name="Britannica"/>
          Later novelists continued to appreciate Tolstoy's art, but sometimes also expressed criticism. [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote "I am attracted by his earnestness and by his power of detail, but I am repelled by his looseness of construction and by his
          unreasonable and impracticable mysticism."<ref name="ACD">{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=Arthur Conan|title=My Favourite Novelist and His Best Book|date= January 1898|location=London|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1306981h.html|access-date=6 October 2017}}</ref>
          [[Virginia Woolf]] declared him "the greatest of all novelists."<ref name="Britannica"/>
          [[James Joyce]] noted that "He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!" [[Thomas Mann]] wrote of Tolstoy's seemingly guileless artistry: "Seldom did art work so much like nature." [[Vladimir Nabokov]] heaped
          superlatives upon ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' and ''Anna Karenina''; he questioned, however, the reputation of ''War and Peace'', and sharply criticized ''[[Resurrection (Tolstoy novel)|Resurrection]]'' and ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]''.
          ==Religious and political beliefs==
          {{anarchism sidebar}}
          [[File:Ilya Repin - Leo Tolstoy Barefoot - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Tolstoy dressed in peasant clothing, by [[Ilya Repin]] (1901)]] After reading [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Tolstoy
          gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes. In 1869 he writes: "Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of
          spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer".<ref>Tolstoy's Letter to A.A. Fet, 30 August 1869</ref>
          In Chapter VI of ''[[A Confession]]'', Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer's work. It explains how a complete [[self-denial|denial of self]] causes only a relative nothingness which is not to be feared. Tolstoy was struck by the
          description of Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer's ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of
          the will:
          <blockquote>
            But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for [[eternal salvation]] is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior ([[Matthew 19:24]]): "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to
            enter into the kingdom of God." Therefore, those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose [[simple living|voluntary poverty]] when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus Buddha [[Sakyamuni]] was
            born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant's staff; and [[Francis of Assisi]], the founder of the [[mendicant orders]] who, as a youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together, was asked: "Now
            Francis, will you not soon make your choice from these beauties?" and who replied: "I have made a far more beautiful choice!" "Whom?" "''La povertà'' (poverty)": whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a
            mendicant.<ref>Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. II, §&nbsp;170</ref>
          </blockquote>
          In 1884, Tolstoy wrote a book called ''What I Believe'', in which he openly confessed his Christian beliefs. He affirmed his belief in Jesus Christ's teachings and was particularly influenced by the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and the injunction to
          [[turn the other cheek]], which he understood as a "commandment of non-resistance to evil by force" and a doctrine of [[pacifism]] and [[nonviolence]]. In his work ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'', he explains that he considered mistaken the
          Church's doctrine because they had made a "perversion" of Christ's teachings. Tolstoy also received letters from American [[Quakers]] who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as [[George Fox]], [[William Penn]] and
          [[Jonathan Dymond]]. Tolstoy believed being a Christian required him to be a pacifist; the apparently inevitable waging of war by governments, is why he is considered a philosophical anarchist. Later, various versions of "Tolstoy's Bible" were
          published, indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on, specifically, the reported words of Jesus himself.<ref>Orwin, Donna T. ''The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy''. Cambridge University Press, 2002</ref>
          [[File:Gandhi Tolstoy Farm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]] and other residents of [[Tolstoy Farm]], South Africa, 1910]] Tolstoy believed that a true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner
          perfection through following the [[Great Commandment]] of loving one's neighbor and God, rather than guidance from the Church or state. Another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ's teachings is [[nonresistance]] during conflict.
          This idea in Tolstoy's book ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' directly influenced [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and therefore also nonviolent resistance movements to this day. Tolstoy believed that the aristocracy was a burden on the poor, and that the
          only way to live together is [[Christian anarchism|anarchism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Philosopher [[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the ''[[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':<blockquote>Without naming himself an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy, like his predecessors in the popular religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Petr Chelčický|Chojecki]], [[Hans Denck|Denk]] and many others, took the anarchist position as regards the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[property right]]s, deducing his conclusions from the general spirit of the teachings of Jesus and from the necessary dictates of reason. With all the might of his talent, Tolstoy made (especially in ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'') a powerful criticism of the church, the state and law altogether, and especially of the present [[property law]]s. He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non-religious reader alike.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Kropotkin |year=1911 |publisher= New York : Encyclopaedia Britannica|page=918 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri01chisrich#page/918/mode/2up |quote=Anarchism}}</ref></blockquote> [[File:Tolstoy organising famine relief in Samara, 1891.jpg|thumb|left|Tolstoy organising [[Russian famine of 1891–92|famine relief]] in Samara, 1891]] Tolstoy denounced the intervention by the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in [[Qing dynasty|China]],<ref name="Orwin2002">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SC9suBt-Vm4C&q=Tolstoy+boxers&pg=PA37|title=The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy|author=Donna Tussing Orwin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-521-52000-3|pages=37–}}</ref><ref name="Tolstoy(graf)1978">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2TVgAAAAMAAJ&q=Boxer|title=Tolstoy's Letters: 1880–1910|author1=Leo Tolstoy|author2=Leo Tolstoy (graf)|author3=Reginald Frank Christian|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group, Limited|year=1978|isbn=978-0-485-71172-1|page=580}}</ref>

          recommended books by [[Kropotkin]] and [[Proudhon]] to his readers, while rejecting anarchism's espousal of [[propaganda of the deed|violent revolutionary means]]. In the 1900 essay, "On Anarchy", he wrote: "The Anarchists are right in everything; in
          the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution.
          But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution—a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man." Despite his misgivings about
          [[anarchist violence]], Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of [[anarchism in Russia|anarchist thinkers in Russia]], and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's "Words of a Rebel", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.<ref>''[[Peter Kropotkin: From Prince to Rebel]]''.

          Tolstoy and George both rejected private property in land (the most important source of income for Russian aristocracy that Tolstoy heavily criticized). They also rejected a centrally planned [[socialist]] economy. Because Georgism requires an
          administration to collect [[economic rent|land rent]] and spend it on infrastructure, some assume that this embrace moved Tolstoy away from his [[anarchist]] views. However, anarchist versions of Georgism have been proposed since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-state.com/geo/foldvary1.html|title=Geoanarchism|author-link=Fred E.

          Tolstoy's 1899 novel ''Resurrection'' explores his thoughts on Georgism and hints that Tolstoy had such a view. It suggests small communities with local governance to manage the collective land rents for common goods, while still heavily criticising
          [[Sovereign state|state]] institutions such as the [[justice system]]. == Death == [[File:Tula YasnayaPolyana asv2019-09 img12 LNTolstoy grave.jpg|thumb|right|Tolstoy's grave with flowers at [[Yasnaya Polyana]]]] Tolstoy died in 1910, aged 82. Just

          {{cleanup merge|1=Leo Tolstoy's influence|21=section}} Although Leo Tolstoy was regarded as a [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] and not a socialist, his ideas and works still influenced socialist thinkers throughout history. He held an unromantic view of governments as being essentially violent forces held together by intimidation from state authority, corruption on behalf of officials, and the indoctrination of people from a young age.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Higgs|first=Robert|date=2015|title=Tolstoy's Manifesto on the State, Christian Anarchy, and Pacifism|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24564569|journal=The Independent Review|volume=19|issue=3|pages=471–479|jstor=24564569|issn=1086-1653}}</ref>

        In his view, a simplified economy would afford a lesser need for the exchange of goods, and as such, factories and cities – the centers of industry – would become obsolete.<ref name=":0"/>
        In 1944, literary historian and Soviet medievalist Nikolai Gudzii wrote a biography of Tolstoy that spanned 80 pages. It was designed to show readers that Tolstoy would've revised his pacifistic and anti-patriotic sentiments if he were alive amid
        World War II.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Emerson|first=Caryl|title=Remarkable Tolstoy, from the Age of Empire to the Putin Era (1894–2006)|date=2016|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26633177|journal=The Slavic and East European Journal|volume=60|issue=2|pages=252–271|doi=10.30851/60.2.007|jstor=26633177|issn=0037-6752}}</ref>
        At around the same time, literary scholar and historian [[Boris Eikhenbaum]] – in a stark contrast from his earlier works on Tolstoy – portrayed the Russian novelist as someone whose ideas aligned with those of early utopian socialists such as
        [[Robert Owen]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon|Henri Saint-Simon]]. Eikenbaum suggested that these influences can be seen in Tolstoy's emphases on individual happiness and peasant welfare.<ref name=":4"/>

        While Tolstoy himself never associated with the movement, as he was opposed to joining any organization or group, he named his thirteenth daughter [[Alexandra Tolstaya|Alexandra (Sasha) L'vovna Tolstaya]] the heir to his works with the intention that
        she would publish them for the Russian people.<ref name=":1"/>
        Meanwhile, Tolstoy designated [[Vladimir Chertkov]] – who kept many of Tolstoy's manuscripts – as the editor of his works. Originally Tolstoy wanted to make the Russian people the heirs to his writings, but Russian law at the time decreed that
        property could only be inherited by one individual.<ref name=":1"/>
        Following the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1917, writings that were formerly censored could now be published, since the all literary works were nationalized in November 1918.<ref name=":1"/>
        Alexandra worked during these years to publish sets of Tolstoy's works: from 1917 to 1919, she worked with Zadruga Publishing House to publish thirteen booklets on Tolstoy's writings, which had previously been censored under Russia's imperial rule.
        However, publishing a complete collection of Tolstoy's works proved to be more difficult. In December 1918, the Commissariat of Education granted Chertkov a 10 million rouble subsidy to publish a complete edition of his works, but it never
        materialized due to government control of publication rights.<ref name=":1"/>
        Cooperatives were additionally made illegal in Russia in 1921, creating another obstacle for Alexandra and Chertkov.<ref name=":1"/>
        In the 1920s, Tolstoy's estate, [[Yasnaya Polyana]], was sanctioned by the Soviet regime to exist as a commune for Tolstoyans. The regime permitted this Christian-oriented community because they felt as if religious sects like the Tolstoyans were
        models for the Russian peasantry.<ref name=":1"/>
        The Soviet government owned the estate, which was deemed a memorial for the late Russian writer, but Alexandra had jurisdiction over the education offered at Yasnaya Polyana. Unlike most Soviet schools, the schooling at Yasnaya Polyana did not offer
        militaristic training and did spread atheistic propaganda. Over time, though, local communists – as opposed to the state government, which financially supported the institution – often denounced the estate and called for frequent inspections. After
        1928, a change in cultural policy in the Soviet regime led to a takeover of local institutions, including Tolstoy's estate. When Alexandra stepped down from her role as head of Yasnaya Poliana in 1929, the Commissariat of Education and Health took
        control.<ref name=":1"/>
        In 1925, the Soviet government created its first Jubilee Committee to celebrate the centennial of Tolstoy's birth, which originally consisted of 13 members but grew to 38 members after a second committee formed in 1927.<ref name=":1"/>
        Alexandra was not content with the funds provided by the government, and met with Stalin in June 1928. During the meeting, Stalin said the government could not provide the one million roubles requested by the committee.<ref name=":1"/>
        However, an agreement was reached with the State Publishing House in April 1928 for the publishing of a 92-volume collection of Tolstoy's works.<ref name=":1"/>
        During the Jubilee Celebration, [[Anatoly Lunacharsky|Anatoly Luncharsky]] – the head of the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] – gave a speech in which he refuted reports that claimed the Soviet government was hostile towards Tolstoy and his
        legacy. Instead of focusing on the aspects of Tolstoy's works that pitted him against the Soviet regime, he instead focused on the unifying aspects, such as Tolstoy's love for equality and labor as well as his disdain for the state and private
        property.<ref name=":1"/>
        More than 400 million copies of Tolstoy's works have been printed in the Soviet Union, making him the best-selling author in Soviet Russia.<ref name="NYTIMES1987">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DB1E30F936A25751C0A961948260 New York Times] February 15, 1987</ref>
        === Influence === [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote several essays about Tolstoy, suggesting that a contradiction exists within his critique of Russian society. According to Lenin, Tolstoy – who adorned the peasantry and voiced their discontent with imperial
        Russian society – may have been revolutionary in his critiques, but his political conscious was not fully developed for a revolution.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=BOER|first=ROLAND|date=2014|title=Lenin on Tolstoy: Between Imaginary Resolution and Revolutionary Christian Communism|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24583606|journal=Science & Society|volume=78|issue=1|pages=41–60|doi=10.1521/siso.2014.78.1.41|jstor=24583606|issn=0036-8237}}</ref>
        Lenin uses this line of thinking to suggest that the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], which he called a "peasant bourgeois revolution," failed because of its backwardness: the revolutionaries wanted to dismantle the existing medieval forms of oppression
        and replace them with an old and patriarchal village-commune.<ref name=":2"/>
        Tolstoy's concept of non-resistance to evil additionally hindered the 1905 revolution's success, Lenin thought, because the movement was not militant and had thus allowed the autocracy to crush them.<ref name=":2"/>
        Nevertheless, Stalin concludes in his writings that despite the many contradictions in Tolstoy's critiques, his hatred for feudalism and capitalism mark the prelude to proletarian socialism.<ref name=":2"/>
        Additionally, Tolstoy's philosophy of non-resistance to evil made an impact on [[Mahatma Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi's]] political thinking. Gandhi was deeply moved by Tolstoy's concept of truth, which, in his view, constitutes any doctrine that reduces
        suffering.<ref name=":3"/>
        For both Gandhi and Tolstoy, truth is God, and since God is universal love, truth must therefore also be universal love. The Gujarati word for Gandhi's non-violent movement is "satyagraha," derived from the word "sadagraha" – the "sat" portion
        translating to "truth," and the "agraha" translating to "firmness."<ref name=":3"/>
        Gandhi's conception of satyagraha was birthed from Tolstoy's understanding of Christianity, rather than from Hindu tradition.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=Stuart|last2=Hughes|first2=Thomas M.|title=Gandhi's Devotional Political Thought|date=2015|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43830813|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=65|issue=2|pages=375–400|doi=10.1353/pew.2015.0051|jstor=43830813|s2cid=142595907|issn=0031-8221}}</ref> === In films === A 2009 film about Tolstoy's final year, ''[[The Last Station]]'', based on the 1990 novel by [[Jay Parini]], was made by director [[Michael Hoffman (American director)|Michael Hoffman]] with [[Christopher Plummer]] as Tolstoy and [[Helen Mirren]] as Sofya Tolstoya. Both performers were nominated for [[Academy Award|Oscars]] for their roles. There have been other films about the writer, including ''[[Departure of a Grand Old Man]]'', made in 1912 just two years after his death, ''How Fine, How Fresh the Roses Were'' (1913), and ''Leo Tolstoy'', directed by and starring [[Sergei Gerasimov (film director)|Sergei Gerasimov]] in 1984. There is also a famous [[lost film]] of Tolstoy made a decade before he died. In 1901, the American travel lecturer [[Burton Holmes]] visited Yasnaya Polyana with [[Albert J. Beveridge]], the U.S. senator and historian. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm movie camera. Afterwards, Beveridge's advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that the meeting with the Russian author might hurt Beveridge's chances of running for the U.S. presidency.<ref>Wallace, Irving, 'Everybody's Rover Boy', in ''The Sunday Gentleman''.

In a career spanning over six decades, Mailer had 11 best-selling books, at least one in each of the seven decades after World War II—more than any other post-war American writer.{{sfn|Lennon|2008|p=270}} His novel ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]'' was published in 1948 and brought him early and wide renown. His 1968 nonfiction novel ''[[Armies of the Night]]'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for non-fiction as well as the [[National Book Award]]. His best-known work is widely considered to be ''[[The Executioner's Song]]'', the 1979 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Mailer is considered an innovator of "creative non-fiction" or "[[New Journalism]]", along with [[Truman Capote]], [[Joan Didion]], [[Hunter S. Thompson]], and [[Tom Wolfe]], a genre which uses the style and devices of literary fiction in fact-based journalism. He was a cultural commentator and critic, expressing his views through his novels, journalism, frequent media appearances, and essays, the most famous and reprinted of which is "[[The White Negro]]". In 1955, he and three others founded ''[[The Village Voice]]'', an arts- and politics-oriented weekly newspaper distributed in [[Greenwich Village]]. In 1960, he was convicted of assault and served a three-year probation after he [[Stabbing of Adele Morales by Norman Mailer|stabbed his wife]] [[Adele Morales]] with a penknife, nearly killing her. In 1969, he ran an unsuccessful campaign to become the mayor of New York. Mailer was married six times and had nine children. ==Early life== Nachem "Norman" Malech ("King"){{efn|Though Kingsley was used on the birth certificate.}}
                  Mailer was born to a Jewish family in [[Long Branch, New Jersey]] on January 31, 1923.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|pp=13–14}}{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=13}}
                  His father, Isaac Barnett Mailer, popularly known as "Barney", was an accountant{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=13}}
                  born in [[South Africa]], and his mother, Fanny (''née'' Schneider), ran a housekeeping and nursing agency. Mailer's sister, Barbara, was born in 1927.{{sfn|McGrath|2007|}}
                  Raised in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]], Mailer graduated from [[Boys High School (Brooklyn)|Boys High School]]<!-- no apostrophe! -->
                  and entered [[Harvard College]] in 1939, when he was 16 years old. As an undergraduate, he was a member of the [[Signet Society]]. At Harvard, he majored in engineering sciences, but took the majority of his electives as writing courses.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|pp=24 and 55}}
                  He published his first story, "The Greatest Thing in the World," at the age of 18, winning [[Story (magazine)|''Story'' magazine]]'s college contest in 1941.{{sfn|Lennon|Lennon|2018|loc=41.1}}
                  After graduating in 1943, Mailer married his first wife Beatrice "Bea" Silverman in January 1944, just before being drafted into the U.S. Army.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=58}}
                  Hoping to gain a deferment from service, Mailer argued that he was writing an "important literary work" which pertained to the war.{{sfn|Beha|2013|}}
                  This deferral was denied, and Mailer was forced to enter the Army.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=59}}
                  After training at Fort Bragg, Mailer was stationed in the [[Philippine]]s with the 112th Cavalry.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=66}}
                  During his time in the Philippines, Mailer was first assigned to regimental headquarters as a typist, then assigned as a wire lineman. In early 1945, after volunteering for a reconnaissance platoon, he completed more than two dozen patrols in
                  contested territory, and engaged in a few firefights and skirmishes. After the Japanese surrender, he was sent to [[Japan]] as part of the army of occupation, was promoted to sergeant, and became a first cook and argued about his girth.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|pp=66–71}}
                  When asked about his war experiences, he said that the army was "the worst experience of my life, and also the most important".{{sfn|Mailer|2019|p=12}}
                  While in Japan and the Philippines, Mailer wrote to his wife Bea almost daily, and these approximately 400 letters became the foundation of ''The Naked and the Dead''.{{sfn|Mailer|2019|p=13}}
                  He drew on his experience as a reconnaissance rifleman for the central action of the novel: a long patrol behind enemy lines.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|pp=72–73}}

                  ==Novelist== [[File:Norman Mailer writing, cropped.jpg|thumb|Mailer writing at his desk, 1967]] Mailer wrote 12 novels in 59 years. After completing courses in French language and culture at the [[University of Paris]] in 1947–48, he returned to the
                  U.S. shortly after ''The Naked and the Dead'' was published in May 1948.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=108}}
                  A ''New York Times'' best seller for 62 weeks, it was the only one of Mailer's novels to reach the number one position.{{sfn|Lennon|2008|p=271}}

                  ''[[Barbary Shore]]'' (1951) was not well received by the critics.{{sfn|Rollyson|1991|p=71}}
                  It was a surreal parable of [[Cold War]] leftist politics set in a Brooklyn rooming-house, and Mailer's most autobiographical novel.{{sfn|Manso|2008|p=155}}
                  His 1955 novel, ''[[The Deer Park]]'' drew on his experiences working as a screenwriter in Hollywood from 1949 to 1950. It was initially rejected by seven publishers due to its purportedly sexual content before being published by [[G. P. Putnam's
                  Sons|Putnam's]]. It was not a critical success, but it made the best-seller list, sold over 50,000 copies its first year,{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=198}}
                  and is considered by some critics to be the best Hollywood novel since [[Nathanael West]]'s ''[[The Day of the Locust]]''.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=162}}{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=214}}{{sfn|Rhodes|2010|p=139}}
                  Mailer wrote his fourth novel, ''[[An American Dream (novel)|An American Dream]]'', as a serial in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine over eight months (January to August 1964), publishing the first chapter two months after he wrote it. In
                  March 1965, [[Dial Press]] published a revised version. The novel generally received mixed reviews, but was a best seller.{{sfn|Lennon|2008a|}}
                  [[Joan Didion]] praised it in a review in ''[[National Review]]'' (April 20, 1965) and John W. Aldridge did the same in ''Life '' (March 19, 1965), while Elizabeth Hardwick panned it in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' (spring 1965).{{sfn|Merrill|1978|pp=69–70}}
                  In 1980, ''[[The Executioner's Song]]'', Mailer's "real-life novel" of the life and death of murderer [[Gary Gilmore]], won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for fiction.{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=351}}
                  Joan Didion reflected the views of many readers when she called the novel "an absolutely astonishing book" at the end of her front-page review in the ''New York Times Book Review''.{{sfn|Didion|1979|}}
                  Mailer spent a longer time writing ''[[Ancient Evenings]]'', his novel of Egypt in the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] (about 1100 BC), than any of his other books. He worked on it for periods from 1972 until 1983. It was also a
                  bestseller, although reviews were generally negative. Harold Bloom, in his review said the book "gives every sign of truncation", and "could be half again as long, but no reader will wish so",{{sfn|Bloom|2003|p=34}}
                  while [[Richard Poirier]] called it Mailer's "most audacious book".{{sfn|Poirier|2003|p=49}}
                  ''[[Harlot's Ghost]]'', Mailer's longest novel (1310 pages), appeared in 1991 and received his best reviews since ''The Executioner's Song''.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=647}}
                  It is an exploration of the untold dramas of the [[CIA]] from the end of World War II to 1965. He performed a huge amount of research for the novel, which is still on CIA reading lists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
                  He ended the novel with the words "To be continued" and planned to write a sequel, titled ''Harlot's Grave'', but other projects intervened and he never wrote it. ''Harlot's Ghost'' sold well. His final novel, ''[[The Castle in the Forest]]'', which
                  focused on Hitler's childhood, reached number five on the ''Times'' best-seller list after publication in January 2007.{{sfn|Lennon|2008|p=271}}
                  It received reviews that were more positive than any of his books since ''The Executioner's Song.'' ''Castle'' was intended to be the first volume of a trilogy, but Mailer died several months after it was completed. ''The Castle in the Forest''
                  received a laudatory 6,200-word front-page review by [[Lee Siegel (cultural critic)|Lee Siegel]] in the ''New York Times Book Review'',{{sfn|Siegel|2007|}}

                  ==Journalist== From the mid-1950s, Mailer became known for his [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] essays. In 1955, he co-founded ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and was initially an investor and silent partner,{{sfn|Menand|2009|}}
                  but later he wrote a column called "Quickly: A Column for Slow Readers" from January to April 1956.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worksdays.projectmailer.net/56-1-56-17/ |title=56.1–56.17 |last=Lennon |display-authors=etal |first=J.

                  His articles published in this column, 17 in total, were important in his development of a philosophy of hip, or "American existentialism," and allowed him to discover his penchant for journalism.{{sfn|Menand|2009|}}
                  Mailer's famous essay "[[The White Negro]]" (1957) fleshes out the [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] figure who stands in opposition of forces that seek debilitating conformity in American society.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=219}}{{sfn|Leeds|1969|p=145}}
                  It is believed to be among the most anthologized, and controversial, essays of the postwar period.{{sfn|Lennon|1988|p=x}}
                  Mailer republished it in 1959 in his miscellany ''[[Advertisements for Myself]]'', which he described as "The first work I wrote with a style I could call my own."{{sfn|Mailer|2003|p=74}}
                  The reviews were positive, and most commentators referred to it as his breakthrough work.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|pp=257–58}}
                  In 1960, Mailer wrote "[[Superman Comes to the Supermarket]]" for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, an account of the emergence of [[John F. Kennedy]] during the Democratic Party convention. The essay was an important breakthrough for the
                  [[New Journalism]] of the 1960s, but when the magazine's editors changed the title to "Superman Comes to the Supermart", Mailer was enraged, and would not write for ''Esquire'' for years. (The magazine later apologized. Subsequent references are to
                  the original title.) Mailer took part in the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam#1967 March on the Pentagon|October 1967 march on the Pentagon]], but initially had no intention of writing a book about it.{{sfn|Grace|Roday|1973|p=231}}
                  After conversations with his friend, [[Willie Morris]], editor of ''[[Harper's]]'' magazine, he agreed to produce a long essay describing the march.{{sfn|Morris|1994|p=213–15}}
                  In a concentrated effort, he produced a 90,000-word piece in two months, and it appeared in ''Harper'''s March issue. It was the longest nonfiction piece to be published by an American magazine.{{sfn|Morris|1994|p=219}}
                  As one commentator states, "Mailer disarmed the literary world with ''Armies''. The combination of detached, ironic self-presentation [he described himself in the third person], deft portraiture of literary figures (especially [[Robert Lowell]],
                  [[Dwight Macdonald]], and [[Paul Goodman]]), a reported flawless account of the March itself, and a passionate argument addressed to a divided nation, resulted in a sui generis narrative praised by even some of his most inveterate revilers."{{sfn|Lennon|1986|p=11}}
                  Alfred Kazin, writing in the ''New York Times Book Review'', said, "Mailer's intuition is that the times demand a new form. He has found it."{{sfn|Kazin|1968|}}

                  The hallmark of his five New Journalism works in his use of [[illeism]], or referring to oneself in the third person, rather than the first. Mailer said he got the idea from reading ''[[The Education of Henry Adams]]'' (1918) when he was a Harvard
                  freshman.{{sfn|Mailer|2003|p=99}}
                  Mailer also employs many of the most common techniques of fiction in his creative nonfiction. ==Filmmaker== In addition to his experimental fiction and [[nonfiction novel]]s, Mailer produced a play version of ''The Deer Park'' (staged at the
                  [[Theatre De Lys]] in [[Greenwich Village]] in 1967),<ref>Guernsey, Otis L. "Curtain Times: The New York Theater 1965–1987". ''Applause 1987''. Play review page 78.</ref>
                  which had a four-month run and generally good reviews.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=372}}
                  In 2007, months before he died, he re-wrote the script, and asked his son [[Michael Mailer|Michael]], a film producer, to film a staged production in Provincetown, but had to cancel because of his declining health.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|pp=752, 757}}
                  Mailer obsessed over ''The Deer Park'' more than any he did over any other work.{{efn| According to {{harvtxt|Lennon|2013|pp=755, 757}}, Mailer was trying to rewrite the play (already revised several times) in the last months of his life, suggests this obsession.

                  note that he began adapting it in 1956, but did not complete it for over a decade. In the eighties, he also had Joan Didion and her husband John Gregory Dunne write a screenplay of it, but didn't like it. Stephan

                    his daughter, [[Kate Mailer]]. The film also featured a variable list of Hollywood stars such as [[Woody Allen]] and [[Peter Sellers]]. However, tensions surfaced between Mailer and Godard early in the production when Godard insisted that Mailer play
                    a character who had a carnal relationship with his own daughter.

                    Mailer's approach to biography came from his interest in the ego of the artist as an "exemplary type".{{sfn|Mailer|1971a|}}
                    His own biographer, [[J. Michael Lennon]], explains that Mailer would use "himself as a species of divining rod to explore the psychic depths" of disparate personalities, like [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Gary Gilmore]], [[Lee Harvey
                    Oswald]], and [[Marilyn Monroe]]. "Ego," states Lennon, "can be seen as the beginning of a major phase in his writing career: Mailer as biographer."{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=435}}
                    Beginning as an assignment from [[Lawrence Schiller]] to write a short preface to a collection of photographs,{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=458}}
                    Mailer's 1973 biography of Monroe (usually designated ''[[Marilyn: A Biography]]''){{efn|The book is commonly referenced as ''Marilyn: A Biography'', e.g. in Michael Lennon's ''Critical Essays''.

Mailer read the available biographies, watched Monroe's films, and looked at photographs of Monroe;{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=316}}
                    for the rest of it, Mailer stated, "I speculated."{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=463}}
                    Since Mailer did not have the time to thoroughly research the facts surrounding her death, his speculation led to the biography's controversy. The book's final chapter theorizes that Monroe was murdered by rogue agents of the [[FBI]] and [[CIA]] who
                    resented her supposed affair with [[Robert F. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Lennon|2013|pp=464, 467}}
                    Mailer later admitted that he embellished the book with speculations about Monroe's sex life and death that he did not himself believe to ensure its commercial success.<ref name="Churchwell2004">{{Cite book | last=Churchwell |first=Sarah | title=The Many Lives of Marilyn Monroe | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7baA2Od48_kC | publisher=Granta Books |year=2004 | isbn=1-86207-6952 | pages = 301–302}}</ref>
                    In his own autobiography, Monroe's former husband [[Arthur Miller]] wrote that Mailer saw himself as Monroe "in drag, acting out his own Hollywood fantasies of fame and sex unlimited and power."<ref>{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Arthur |date=2012 |orig-year=1988 |title=Timebends: A Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=he8_AQAAQBAJ |location=New York |publisher=Bloomsbury |page=532 |isbn=978-1408836316 }}</ref>
                    The book was enormously successful; it sold more copies than did any of Mailer's works except ''The Naked and the Dead'', and it is Mailer's most widely reviewed book.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=468}}

                    Two later works co-written by Mailer presented imagined words and thoughts in Monroe's voice: the 1980 book ''[[Of Women and Their Elegance]]'' and the 1986 play ''[[Strawhead]]'', which was produced [[off Broadway]] starring his daughter [[Kate
                    Mailer]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Atlas |first=James |date=April 1986 |title=The First Sitting |magazine=Vanity Fair }}</ref>
                    In the wake of the ''Marilyn'' controversy, Mailer attempted to explain his unique approach to biography. He suggests that his biography must be seen as a "''species'' of novel ready to play by the rules of biography."{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=316}}
                    Exemplary egos, he explains, are best explained by other exemplary egos, and personalities like Monroe's are best left in the hands of a novelist.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=469}}
                    ==Activist== A number of Mailer's nonfiction works, such as ''[[The Armies of the Night]]'' and ''The Presidential Papers'', are political. He covered the [[Republican National Convention|Republican]] and [[Democratic National Convention]]s in 1960,
                    1964, 1968, 1972, 1992, and 1996, although his account of the 1996 Democratic convention has never been published. In the early 1960s he was fixated on the figure of President [[John F. Kennedy]], whom he regarded as an "existential hero". In the
                    late 1950s and throughout the 1960s and 1970s, his work mingled autobiography, social commentary, history, fiction, and poetry in a formally original way that influenced the development of [[New Journalism]]. Mailer held the position that the [[Cold
                    War]] was not a positive ideal for America. It allowed the state to become strong and invested in the daily lives of the people. He critiqued conservative politics as they, specifically those of Barry Goldwater, supported the Cold War and an increase
                    in government spending and oversight. This, Mailer argued, stood in opposition with conservative principles such as lower taxes and smaller government. He believed that conservatives were pro-Cold War because that was politically relevant to them and
                    would therefore help them win.{{Sfn|Mailer|1998|p=854}}
                    <!--This ref seems incorrect, again below.-->
                    Indeed, Mailer was outspoken about his mistrust of politics in general as a way of meaningful change in America. In ''Miami and the Siege of Chicago'' (1968), he explained his view of "politics-as-property", likening a politician to a property holder
                    who is "never ambivalent about his land, he does not mock it or see other adjacent estates as more deserving than his own." Thus politics is just people trading their influence as capital in an attempt to serve their own interests. This cynical view
                    of politicians serving only themselves perhaps explains his views on [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]. Mailer saw politics as a sporting event: "If you played for a team, you did your best to play very well, but there was something obscene ... in
                    starting to think there was more moral worth to Michigan than Ohio State." Mailer thought that Nixon lost and was demonized only because he played for the wrong team. President Johnson, Mailer thought, was just as bad as Nixon had been, but he had
                    good charisma so all was forgiven.{{Sfn|Mailer|1998|p=854}}
                    In September 1961, Mailer was one of 29 original prominent American sponsors of the [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]] organization with which [[John F. Kennedy]] assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was associated in 1963. In December 1963, Mailer and
                    several of the other sponsors left the organization.{{efn|Some of the original twenty-nine sponsors of the group included [[Truman Capote]], Robert Taber, [[James Baldwin]], [[Robert F.

                    Abbott's time behind bars and the conditions he was experiencing. Mailer, impressed, helped to publish ''[[In the Belly of the Beast]]'', a book on life in the prison system consisting of Abbott's letters to Mailer. Once paroled, Abbott committed a
                    murder in New York City six weeks after his release, stabbing 22-year-old Richard Adan to death. Consequently, Mailer was subject to criticism for his role. In a 1992 interview with the ''[[Buffalo News]]'', he conceded that his involvement was
                    "another episode in my life in which I can find nothing to cheer about or nothing to take pride in."<ref>Ulin, David L. [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/11/local/me-appreciation11 "Mailer: an ego with an insecure streak."]

                    ==Recurring themes==
                    {{original research|date=April 2020}}
                    === Style and views on the body and sex === Bodily urges are fundamental to Mailer's approach to novels and short works. These urges are in tension with the themes of "apocalypse" and morality. Stemming from his Freudian philosophical basis, bodily
                    urges are integral to Mailer's work. The "psychopath" presented in ''The White Negro'' continues to occupy the central narrative of much of Mailer's work throughout his career. The drama of this psychopath for Mailer is that he or she seeks love—but
                    love as the search for an orgasm more "apocalyptic" than the ones that preceded it.{{sfn|Mailer|1959|p=12}}
                    These views on sex were not light vices for Mailer. In ''Armies of the Night'' he postulates at length on "earned manhood," "onanism and sexuality," and "psychic profit derived from the existential assertion of yourself".{{sfn|Mailer|1968|p=24}}
                    The Mailer–reader relationship is also integral to Mailer's literary body trope. Mailer uses frequent allusion and direct use of body-oriented language to describe power structures in ''Miami and the Siege of Chicago'' in the form of the "military
                    spine of the liberal party"{{sfn|Mailer|1998|p=693}}
                    and in the "knifelike entrance into culture"{{sfn|Mailer|1959|p=340}}
                    of jazz in ''The White Negro''. Power over bodies, societies, political entities, etc. is a constant presence in Mailer's work. In addition - and notable for such a prominent mainstream American writer of his generation - Mailer, throughout his work
                    and personal communications, repeatedly expresses interest in, includes episodes of or makes references to bisexuality or homosexuality.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=33}}
                    He even directly addresses the subject publicly in his essay ''The Homosexual Villain'', for ''One'' magazine.{{sfn|Mailer|1959|pp=220–227}}
                    Moments of physical and sexual power or powerlessness are the climax of ''The Naked and the Dead'', "The Time of Her Time", and ''The Armies of the Night.'' His prose presentation of an existential struggle is frequently conveyed to the reader via
                    references to the body. The body is an entity to be poked, prodded, broken, even snuffed into non-existence. By filling his work with graphic depictions of sex, violence, and even rock and roll, Mailer elevates the experience of the reader. Mailer
                    invokes a particularly poignant, violent portrayal of the body, authority, and sexuality in ''The Time of Her Time''. Consistent use of bodily reference or allusion is clearly integral to his depiction of human existence. Mailer elevates the reader
                    experience, and wrestles the reader for domination while allowing room for interpretation. Critiques of Mailer based on sexuality, race, and gender, have been levied by authors such as Kate Millett and bell hooks, among others. Kate Millett, in her
                    ''[[Sexual Politics]],'' critiques Mailer: "His considerable insights into the practice of sexuality as a power game never seem to affect his vivid personal enthusiasm for the fight nor his sturdy conviction that it's kill or be killed."{{sfn|Millett|1970|p=326}}
                    === Race === Throughout his writing, Mailer never presents a very clear perspective on race. His works range from a profound understanding of the African American condition in America to extremely stereotypical depictions of race. For the majority of
                    Mailer's career he does not delve directly into race, but chose to pursue the matter only as a side note to the larger currents of the 1960s and 1970s. Mailer does, however, spend some time working through the issue in "The White Negro", ''Of a Fire
                    on the Moon'', and in his work ''The Fight'' about the heavyweight title bout between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]]. In "The White Negro" Mailer argues that African Americans are psychopaths because they live in a society that hates them
                    (meaning white society), which in turn causes them to hate themselves.{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=129}}
                    Mailer goes on to argue that because of this innate psychopathy, African Americans are left to explore the least virtuous areas of civilized life.{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=129}}
                    Mailer's analysis culminates in his expression that if African Americans were to achieve equality it would have violent and chaotic effects on white society.{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=129}}
                    In ''[[Of a Fire on the Moon]]'' Mailer discusses that the space flight was an exclusive action on the part of white America, as they have left African Americans behind on Earth. African Americans can only look on as whites move even farther past
                    them in not just society, but their earthly constraints.{{sfn|Mailer|1971|}}
                    Mailer uses African Americans to criticize the moon landing, as he reflects on the fact that many problems still exist on Earth, and within America. === Mailer's personal encounters with race === Mailer often directly engaged with racial issues in
                    his works, but some{{who|date=December 2020}}
                    have seen his writings on the subject of race to be problematic.{{weasel inline|date=February 2021}}
                    Mailer focused on Jazz as the ultimate expression of African-American bravado, and figures like [[Miles Davis]] would become represented in works like ''An American Dream''. To Mailer, African-American men reflected a challenge to his own notions of
                    masculinity.{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=117}}
                    While in Paris in 1956, Mailer met the famous African-American author [[James Baldwin]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=121}}
                    Mailer became even more fascinated with African-Americans after meeting Baldwin, and this friendship inspired Mailer to write "The White Negro". To Mailer, Baldwin was a natural point of intrigue as Baldwin was both gay and an African-American
                    author, similar to Mailer's stature.{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=122}}
                    Their relationship was never a close friendship nor contemptuous, but one of mutual intrigue and a sense of competition existed between the two writers. Mailer often commented on Baldwin's work, and Baldwin did the same to Mailer. These comments
                    became increasingly critical as their careers progressed despite their respect for one another. Baldwin wrote a letter disapproving of Mailer's comments on race and sexuality in "The White Negro". He stated the reason for the decline in his
                    relationship with Mailer was "that myth of the sexuality of Negroes which Norman, like so many others, refused to give up". Baldwin said a white American writer "affords too many opportunities to avoid reality". He believed that Mailer did not fully
                    recognize the benefits from his status as a heterosexual male. === Concept of masculinity === The subject of masculinity shows up frequently throughout Mailer's works. Critics have argued{{who|date=December 2020}}
                    that while Mailer says he supports feminism, he unconsciously intertwines his own masculine biases which can be seen through ''Naked and the Dead'' and ''Prisoner of Sex''. In ''Naked and the Dead'', Norman Mailer examines Cummings's struggle with
                    sexuality while on the frontline during World War II. Based on the Good War narrative that has been taught, it is not acknowledged that many men sought comfort with men and women. Mailer's issues of masculinity can be seen in Cummings and Hearn's
                    relationship. Cummings views this relationship more than a friendship, while Hearn does not reciprocate the feeling. Another example of the concept of masculinity being examined is the reason why Cummings was forced to go to military school. Cummings
                    states that "he hears the argument raging about him, conducted in hoarse passionate whispers as a sop to his sleeping brother. I won't have him actin' like a goddamn woman, you're to stop feedin' him all these books, all this womanish...claptrap"{{sfn|Mailer|1948|p=405}}
                    In ''[[The Prisoner of Sex]]'', Mailer questions the [[Women's Liberation Movement]] and the role of women in the society around him. He viewed women as questioning societal roles that posed a risk to interfering with masculine roles that had already
                    been established. In Mailer's eyes, he does not fully comprehend what women were fighting for. ==Personal life== ===Marriages and children=== Mailer was married six times and had nine children. He fathered eight children by his various wives and
                    informally adopted his sixth wife's son from another marriage. Mailer's first marriage was to Beatrice Silverman. They eloped in January 1944 because neither family would likely have approved.{{sfn|Dearborn|1999|p=38}}
                    They had one child, [[Susan Mailer|Susan]], and divorced in 1952 because of Mailer's infidelities with [[Adele Morales]].{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=133}}
                    Morales moved in with Mailer during 1951 into an apartment on First Avenue near Second Street in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]],<ref>Louis Menand, "It Took a Village," The New Yorker, January 5, 2009, p. 38.</ref>
                    and they married in 1954. They had two daughters, Danielle and Elizabeth. After attending a party on Saturday, November 19, 1960, Mailer [[Stabbing of Adele Morales by Norman Mailer|stabbed Adele twice]] with a two-and-a-half inch blade that he used

                    Mailer, who point to themes of sexual violence in his work.<ref>Millet, Kate. ''Sexual Politics'' Virago, 1991. pp. 314–5.</ref>
                    His third wife, whom he married in 1962, and divorced in 1963, was the British heiress and journalist Lady [[Jeanne Campbell]] (1929–2007). She was the only daughter of [[Ian Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll]], a [[Duke of Argyll|Scottish aristocrat]]
                    and [[Clan Campbell|clan chief]] with [[Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll|a notorious private life]], and a granddaughter of the press baron [[Lord Beaverbrook]]. The couple had a daughter, [[Kate Mailer]], who is an actress.{{sfn|Rollyson|1991|pp=144–150}}
                    His fourth marriage, in 1963, was to [[Beverly Bentley]], a former model turned actress. She was the mother of two of his sons, producer [[Michael Mailer]] and actor [[Stephen Mailer]]. They divorced in 1980. His fifth wife was Carol Stevens, a jazz
                    singer whom he married on November 7, 1980, and divorced in [[Haiti]] on November 8, 1980, thereby legitimating their daughter Maggie, born in 1971.{{sfn|Lennon|2013|p=354}}
                    His sixth and last wife, whom he married in 1980, was [[Norris Church Mailer]] (born Barbara Jean Davis, 1949–2010), an art teacher. They had one son together, [[John Buffalo Mailer]], a writer and actor. Mailer raised and informally adopted Matthew
                    Norris, Church's son by her first husband, Larry Norris. Living in Brooklyn, New York and [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] with Mailer, Church worked as a model, wrote and painted. ===Works with his children=== In 2005, Mailer co-wrote a book with his
                    youngest child, John Buffalo Mailer, titled ''The Big Empty''.

                    Later, Leonard was approached by a group of movie distributors from the Midwest to finance what was described as "the world's first million-dollar pornographic movie".<ref name="AVNMailer"/>
                    She invited Mailer to lunch and made her pitch for his services as a writer. In an interview Leonard said that the author "sat straight up in his chair and said, 'I always knew I'd one day make a porny.{{'"}} Leonard then asked what his fee would be and Mailer responded with "Two-hundred fifty thousand". Leonard then asked if he'd be interested in adapting his novel-biography of Marilyn Monroe, but Mailer replied that he wanted to do something original. The project later ended due to scheduling conflicts between the two.<ref name=MailerBlue/> ===Personality=== At the December 15, 1971, taping of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', with [[Janet Flanner]] and [[Gore Vidal]], Mailer, annoyed with a less-than-stellar review by Vidal of ''Prisoner of Sex'', apparently insulted then head-butted Vidal backstage.{{sfn|Patterson|2007|}}
                    As the show began taping, a visibly belligerent Mailer, who admitted he had been drinking, goaded Vidal and Cavett into trading insults with him on-air and referred to his own "greater intellect". He openly taunted and mocked Vidal (who responded in
                    kind), finally earning the ire of Flanner, who announced during the discussion that she was "becoming very, very bored", telling Mailer and Vidal "you act as if you're the only people here." As Cavett made jokes comparing Mailer's intellect to his
                    ego, Mailer stated "Why don't you look at your question sheet and ask your question?", to which Cavett responded "Why don't you fold it five ways and put it where the moon don't shine?"{{sfn|Patterson|2007|}}
                    A long laugh ensued, after which Mailer asked Cavett if he had come up with that line, and Cavett replied "I have to tell you a quote from [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]?". The head-butting and later on-air altercation was described by Mailer himself in his
                    essay "Of a Small and Modest Malignancy, Wicked and Bristling with Dots". According to his obituary in ''[[The Independent]]'', his "relentless machismo seemed out of place in a man who was actually quite small – though perhaps that was where the
                    aggression originated."<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Norman Mailer |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/norman-mailer-400006.html |work=The Independent |location=Obituaries |date=November 12, 2007 |access-date=2018-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730024116/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/norman-mailer-400006.html |archive-date=July 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>
                    [[Alan Dershowitz]], in his book, ''Taking the Stand'', recounts when [[Claus von Bülow]] had a dinner party after he was found not guilty at his trial. Dershowitz countered that he would not attend if it was a "victory party", and von Bülow assured
                    him that it was only a dinner for "several interesting friends". Norman Mailer attended the dinner where, among other things, Dershowitz explained why the evidence pointed to von Bülow's innocence. As Dershowitz recounted, Mailer grabbed [[Norris
                    Church Mailer|his wife's]] arm, and said: "Let's get out of here. I think this guy is innocent. I thought we were going to be having dinner with a man who actually tried to kill his wife. This is boring."{{sfn|Dershowitz|2013|pp=240–241}}

'''The Real Life Guys''' is a German [[YouTube]] channel about amazing do-it-yourself projects. The first videos were uploaded on YouTube in 2016 by the brothers Johannes and Philipp Mickenbecker, including sister Eli, from [[Bickenbach, Hesse|Bickenbach]], Hessen, Germany. The channel currently has about one and half million followers.&lt;ref&gt;The Real Life Guys (You Tube): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn0ITRHWS64_zRz5WWeQBkQ&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content and goal of videos ==
The brothers carried out many projects that attracted a large media attention in Germany. They were supported by numerous friends. Bathtubs served as the starting point for many of their projects. Some of their more interesting gadgets were a flying bathtub using drone rotors,&lt;ref&gt;The Real Life Guys: Mit der FLIEGENDEN BADEWANNE zum BÄCKER!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQK9m_OBVgY&lt;/ref&gt; a bathtub submarine with oxygen tanks,&lt;ref&gt;The Real Life Guys: U-BOOT aus unserer BADEWANNE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBEUj4eAIU
&lt;/ref&gt; a massive waterslide made of segmented bathtubs,&lt;ref&gt;The Real Life Guys: Wasserrutsche aus BADEWANNEN vom Dach!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJZcWk7x49M&lt;/ref&gt; and a Godzilla image in a lake.&lt;ref&gt;The Real Life Guys: Wir bauen GODZILLA in REAL LIFE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbH_aP4trX0&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the brothers was to use the videos to encourage young people to go into the great outdoors and experience adventures. They tried to encourage young people not only to spend their time in front of the computer and cell phone.

Tragedy struck the family when their sister Eli died in a plane crash in 2018.

In October 2020, Philipp announced on a video that he was suffering from lymph gland cancer in his chest. It was first discovered in 2013 and it went into remission after chemotherapy. The cancer had unfortunately returned and it was shown to be terminal.&lt;ref&gt;Der Spiegel. Uns ist bewusst geworden, wie kurz das Leben sein kann, (24.12.2020). https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/the-real-life-guys-philipp-mickenbecker-und-sein-zwillingsbruder-johannes-ueber-gott-und-den-krebs-a-333615ce-24f3-4045-9c76-2ddcf11147b8
&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillpp and Johannes continued to make videos as long as possible, despite Philipp's failing health. The brothers made a TV documentary on ARD at the end of 2020 which was seen all over Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Real Life Guy - der YouTuber, der Tod und die Hoffnung. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDvrr6xI_70&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers mentioned that it was their Christian faith that gave them hope to persevere. The Brothers also worked with the video channel 'Life Lion'.

Philipp died on June 9, 2021, at a clinic in Darmstadt. He was buried next to his deceased sister in Bickenbach.&lt;ref&gt;T-Online.de: YouTube-Star Philipp Mickenbecker ist tot (10.06.2021).

&lt;/ref&gt;

Johannes married his girlfriend Lara in July 2021. He said in a video and on German TV that they would continue making videos on the Real Life Guys channel.
